> **COMBAT APPROACHABILITY IN MIDNIGHT**
> With Midnight, we aim to make gameplay clearer and easier to understand, so the path to improvement is more apparent for players at every skill level, while maintaining the depth of mastery that WoW offers.
>We are updating every class specialization with an eye towards approachability by reducing complexity and making gameplay more intuitive. We are beginning by focusing on what makes each specialization unique and designing gameplay that matches their theme, so your character’s personality and style are reflected in how you play. Our goal is for the most appealing, visible elements of your spec to be what matter most in gameplay. That often means managing resources, tracking a few key buffs and debuffs, using ability charges strategically, and responding to important triggered effects (also known as “procs”).
>We want to ensure that players have all the necessary information to play a spec with clearly visible prompts and indicators in the user interface. This can include changing the design of complex abilities or reducing the number of buffs or debuffs that can be active, so it’s easier to pick out the most essential information on enemy nameplates or in the Cooldown Manager.
>We are also reviewing the amount of concentration or “cognitive load” required to play each spec. Cognitive load encompasses tasks such as keeping track of active auras, parsing conditions to choose the most effective ability in a given moment, or remembering long sequences of abilities. Some specs will demand more cognitive load than others by design. Keeping track of damage over time effects requires concentration, but is also a big part of the appeal of specs like Affliction, Feral, and Assassination! However, we are reviewing all specs for areas where concentration demands are excessive, unclear, or don’t serve enjoyable gameplay.
>Ultimately, our goal is that once every spec has all its new class talent points, Hero Talents, and Apex Talents, it has what we feel is a manageable, fun, and appropriately challenging level of complexity.


# Changed

### Warlock
- **FROM**
	- Lastly, we are changing the cooldowns of Affliction to better suit these gameplay changes. First, we are extending the cooldown of Summon Darkglare to 2 minutes (was 1 minute) to reduce the frequency in which players will want to pool Soul Shards to maximize Unstable Affliction with Darkglare. Secondly, we are introducing a new 1 minute cooldown: Dark Harvest. This is an experimental channeled spell that mirrors Malefic Rapture in some ways but instead of scaling per DoT it only needs a single DoT to maximize its throughput. Let us know what you think about this new cooldown and the other changes to Afflictions as we’re excited to hear your thoughts!
