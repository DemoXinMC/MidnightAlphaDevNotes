## [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007134-welcome-home-5)**WELCOME HOME**

When you login, you’ll be given a quest “A House for You” which will lead you to your faction’s Neighborhood, introduce the Steward, and take you on a tour of the Neighborhood, and ultimately direct you to buy your house.

Please note, the house cost is not final and assuming you used a template character, you’ll have plenty of gold to afford it.

Once you have a house, start building! You’ll be able to find a variety of decorations on vendors, professions, and throughout the world and use them to make your house a home. Lay out your rooms and expand into a spooky basement or lofty attic. Explore the Neighborhood and see what’s hidden around the corner or say hi to your neighbors.

Please leave any feedback on the feature in the Housing feedback thread.

During Alpha and Beta, we’ll be adding a ton more content and functionality to Housing, including:

- Moving your house will become possible. **Please be especially careful of your choice since it is not possible to change right now.**
- Exterior decoration (being able to place decor outside) AND exterior customization (being able to change the outside appearance of your house) will both be enabled.
- House exteriors will also be able to upgrade their visual size
- Charter Neighborhoods will be enabled allowing arbitrary groups of players to have a private neighborhood. In the meantime, Guilds can create their own neighborhoods to test.
- Endeavors will be turned on, allowing your Neighborhood to work together to achieve rewards and welcome new NPCs to town.
- Social visiting will be enabled, allowing friends, neighbors, party members, and guild mates to easily visit each other.
- Lumber is very much a work in progress and will be getting a lot of updates, polish, and balancing.
- We’ll be adding tons of new decorations, profession recipes, neighborhood activities, and more content.

### [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007134-known-issues-7)**Known Issues**

There are a number of things we know about already and are actively working on and want you to be aware of ahead of time.

- **Walking towards another player’s doorstep can sometimes cause a crash. Focus on decorating your own home for now.**
- Entering other players’ houses will sometimes take a VERY long time.
- When visiting other players, refreshing the UI list of all their visitable houses can sometimes take a very long time to load.
- As a quick headsup, Dyes are only available via Inscription and Alchemy (and can be placed on the Auction House) so if you’re looking to pretty things up, start there.
- For Alpha, all room placement costs are intentionally set low to enable better testing. Costs will increase to their intended amount during beta and release.
- Private Neighborhoods with names longer than 50+ characters will cause disconnects and crashes. Be brief!
- If you drag decor across room boundaries, a crash can sometimes occur. Put the decor away in your chest and take it out in the target room to avoid this.
- If you have a LOT of decor in a single room and add more, a crash may take place.
- Customizing rooms will always have the “Vaulted” ceiling type option available, though it only works on some room types.
- Houses that are owned by other players will occasionally display the For Sale sign asset even though they’re not for sale.
- You’ll likely encounter a variety of LUA errors. It’s fine to ignore these, but occasionally you may have to relog or reload your UI.
- There are some visual issues with various pieces of decor, rooms, and customizations.

## [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007134-stat-squish-10)**STAT SQUISH**

- Starting in Public Alpha 1, we’ve squished numbers across the board. Like previous squishes, we are reducing values across the board, including player and creature health, damage, healing, item level, and stats on items. This squish will not affect player character levels.
    - For players logging into Public Alpha, the new character templates will reflect the expected player power from levels 80-90.
    - Known issues: Item previews in the Quest Rewards pane can show pre-squished item levels. This is just a display issue, the item will be set to the correct squished item level when it is created.
- _Developers’ notes: We welcome your feedback as we continue to work on this feature. While the squish has been applied across the game, it’s possible some items or effects may have escaped having been squished or have been squished too harshly. Legacy content scaling has also been adjusted to compensate for the squish. Please let us know if you encounter any issues with these or other scaling content._

## [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007134-diminishing-returns-11)**DIMINISHING RETURNS**

- _Developers’ notes: We are making some adjustments to how diminishing returns work in World of Warcraft. “Diminishing returns” refers to the system that reduces the duration of crowd control effects if they are used repeatedly against the same target. In order to make crowd control less frustrating in PvP, players will now become immune after 2 applications of crowd control from the same category (ex. after being stunned twice, you are now immune). We felt that very low duration crowd controls were making it hard to cast spells and generally felt excessive. For PvE, we are removing the immunity after 3 stuns. Our primary goal here is to remove the need to track diminishing returns state on enemies. Instead of enforcing a hidden and complex system to reduce effectiveness of stuns, we are doing a pass on classes and making sure the amount of stuns and their durations are appropriate for combat._
- Diminishing return categories will reset after 16 seconds (was 18 seconds).
- Creatures will no longer be immune to stun effects after 3 applications of the effect. The duration of the stun effect will continue to diminish in half upon each application, until they reach 1/16th duration, where it will remain until 16 seconds have passed.
- In PvP combat, players will be fully immune to a crowd control category after 2 casts (was 3).

    - **Blood**
        - *Developers’ notes: Going into Midnight we had a few pain points with Blood Death Knights that we are looking to address. On initial pull, Blood has an incredibly long ramp up time to both get their defensives rolling but also their offensive power. The main culprit is due to how we turned Boneshield into a damage throughput resource because of the existence of Shattering Bone and Insatiable Blade. Going into Midnight we have removed Shattering Bone and re-distributed its power into Blood’s baseline damage abilities for a more consistent throughput that doesn’t require all the hoops to jump through to start dealing damage. On the topic of Boneshield, we’ve also reduced the number of abilities that deduct from it such as Tombstone and Bonestorm. As a tank you have a lot of things to consider in your role and adding what was essentially a third resource to spend felt like it was slightly too much. Not to say we can’t explore this design in the future, but we will need to be much more cautious and deliberate with these ability designs to ensure its not encroaching on the already existing resource system of Death Knights.*_The other notable change for Blood is focused on making them more reliable in high end Mythic+ keys. Blood historically (outside of the very strong Sepulcher of the First Ones tier set) has been great at low to mid-level keys but started to fall off at higher end keys where their Death Strike healing can’t overcome the damage they start to take. To alleviate some of this we’ve made a pass on Death Strike and all its modifiers to reduce its overall healing but at the same time we’ve re-distributed that power into their baseline defensives, talents, and Boneshield. The goal being to make their damage intake a little more predictable at higher keys and prevent them from “falling over” before they can start to get their other defensives rolling. We love that Blood has carved a niche for itself as the self-sufficient tank and we don’t want that to change. We look forward to hearing your feedback to the above changes as well as the other changes not mentioned as we continue into Alpha and beyond._

        - Apex Talents: Chosen of Frostbrood
            - Frostwyrm’s Fury deals 100% increased damage to the first enemy it hits and grants you 15% Haste for 12 seconds.

        - Empower Rune Weapon effect is now instant and no longer has a projectile.
    - **Unholy**
        - _Developers’ notes: In Midnight, our primary goal for Unholy Death Knight is to deliver fantasy and gameplay that truly embody what it means to be a master of disease and raising the dead. We found Festering Wound to be mechanically overbearing and decided to move away from it. We’re overhauling the core abilities of the spec to create a new rotation that interacts more deeply with your diseases and summoning powers._  
            _To deliver this vision, we’ve introduced a new type of summon called the Lesser Ghoul, placing it at the heart of Unholy’s baseline rotation. Festering Strike now grants a buff that empowers your next couple of Scourge Strikes to summon a Lesser Ghoul—instead of applying a debuff to a single enemy that needs to be spread and tracked throughout an encounter. We’re also updating Army of the Dead to summon these new Lesser Ghouls, and restoring it as Unholy’s primary cooldown by reducing its cooldown to 1.5 minutes._  
            _We recognize that simply having cool ways to summon armies of the dead doesn’t necessarily create meaningful gameplay. That led us to design a new Rune-spending ability called Putrefy—the third rotational partner alongside Festering Strike and Scourge Strike. With Putrefy, you’ll sacrifice your oldest summoned Lesser Ghoul to explode and deal Shadow damage to nearby enemies. We’ve intentionally placed Putrefy early in the specialization tree to enable further fun and meaningful interactions you can opt into. And for those wondering about targeting—don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Just press the button and enjoy the show as your Lesser Ghoul explodes spectacularly.  
            Now that we’ve covered summoning, let’s talk diseases. In Midnight, we’re introducing a new single-target disease called Dread Plague, which will work alongside your AoE disease Virulent Plague. As with summoning, simply applying cool diseases isn’t enough—so we’re redefining some core abilities and bringing Runic Power spenders like Death Coil and Epidemic into the mix. Scourge Strike will now cause your diseases to inflict an additional tick of their periodic damage at a percentage of their effectiveness, while your Runic Power spenders will extend their durations. Extending disease duration becomes important because we’re also introducing a powerful disease consumption mechanic via a talent called Blightburst. When talented into Blightburst, the explosion effect of Putrefy will consume a significant portion of your diseases’ remaining duration and deal that amount of damage instantly.  
            By leveraging the concepts of Lesser Ghoul and Putrefy, we aimed to unify the summoner and master-of-disease fantasies. We hope you’ll find all the other talents we introduced fun and engaging—especially the new Apex Talent, which we believe will fully immerse you in this redefinition of Unholy Death Knight._

    - **Havoc**
        - _Developers’ notes: Midnight brings targeted changes to Havoc focused on two key areas: Reducing total button count of both offensive and defense/utility abilities, especially when they have overlapping identity or functional redundancy; and simplifying circumstances of conditional bonuses that warp ability usage in unintuitive ways, especially those that stem from overlapping buff windows. Many skills have been changed or removed, including talents with unclear or overly-niche purpose. Large multiplicative skill bonuses have been changed or removed to make room for Havoc’s natural gameplay to be fun and effective._
        - Apex Talents will be available for testing in a future build.

        - Blur now reduces damage taken by 25% (was 20%) and no longer increases Dodge chance.

            - Insatiable Hunger
            - Restless Hunter
    - **Vengeance**
        - _Developers’ notes: Vengeance’s Midnight updates are primarily focused on improving the natural usability of its defensive kit. Before Midnight, Vengeance had defensive gaps that made it susceptible to difficult-to-understand deaths; it relied heavily on effects that were conditional or ramped up over time; and it skewed too heavily towards effects that were predictive in nature and required advance knowledge of encounters to use effectively. In Midnight, Vengeance’s defensive kit has been significantly streamlined by increasing baseline defenses, by making Demon Spikes easier to maintain at a high rate, by replacing complex ramp-up effects with simpler versions that reward core rotational gameplay, and by reducing emphasis on predictive effects to make room for more potent reactive ones. Additional changes aim to simplify and clarify Vengeance’s offensive rotation._

                - Symbiotic Blooms no longer appear on raid frames.
    - **Balance**
        - _Developers’ notes: The design of how you enter and maintain Eclipse is changing in Midnight. We’d like to introduce more gameplay to it. Eclipse before Midnight is so important that you immediately drop everything to refresh it when it ends. There’s no timing or strategy to it, and it can be a struggle during phases with high movement. In Midnight, Lunar Eclipse and Solar Eclipse are an active ability that instantly enters Eclipse for 15 seconds, has a 30 second cooldown, and can be talented to have two charges. The goal is for Balance to prepare for each Eclipse and choose the perfect moment to activate it. Depending on talents and the pacing of a fight or dungeon, you might have an Eclipse up 60-80% of the time. You’ll want to spend your time in Eclipse spending Astral Power and dealing damage, and your time out of Eclipse building resources or refreshing DoTs to prepare for your next Eclipse._ _Balance’s Mastery has been changed so Sunfire and Moonfire no longer increase damage targets take and Waning Twilight has been removed. This allows Balance to start dealing damage faster and improves its strength in split cleave fights. Moonfire and Sunfire’s damage will be tuned to keep them as strong, efficient damage dealing spells, but the damage of your other spells will be less conditional._
        - Apex Talent: Ascendant Eclipses
            - Activating an Eclipse makes your next Wrath or Starfire Instant. The first three Starsurges or Starfalls you cast during each Eclipse deal 20% increased damage.
            - Your critical strikes dealt during an Eclipse cause their victims to languish for an additional 20/40% of damage dealt for 6 seconds.
            - Activating an Eclipse also launches Solar or Lunar Bolts at nearby enemies that always critically strike.
                - Solar Bolt: Entering Solar Eclipse launches a Solar Bolt at 1 nearby enemy that deals Nature damage.
                - Lunar Bolts: Entering Lunar Eclipse launches 3 Lunar Bolts at nearby enemies that deal Arcane damage to nearby enemies. Damage reduced beyond 5 targets.

        - Mastery: Astral Invocation has been updated – Your Nature spells deal 0.75_Mastery% increased damage (was 0.5 * Mastery). Your Arcane spells deal 0.75_Mastery% increased damage (was 0.5 * Mastery). Moonfire and Sunfire no longer cause targets to take additional damage from your spells.
        - Eclipse has been redesigned – You may draw the sun and moon into alignment for 15 seconds, empowering either your Nature or Arcane spells. Casting Wrath or Starfire changes what mode of Eclipse will be entered, and the two modes of Eclipse share a button and 32 second cooldown.
            - Lunar Eclipse: Enter a Lunar Eclipse for 15 seconds. Arcane spells deal 15% additional damage and Starfire damage is increased by 40%. Casting Wrath changes this to Solar Eclipse.
            - Solar Eclipse: Enter a Solar Eclipse for 15 seconds. Nature spells deal 15% additional damage and Wrath damage is increased by 40%. Casting Starfire changes this to Lunar Eclipse.
        - Casting Starfire and Wrath no longer enter Eclipse.
            - _Developers’ notes: The intention of this change is to give Balance an element of choosing when to enter Eclipse. You cannot maintain Eclipse at all times, so your goal will be to maximize your damage while you are in Eclipse, and to spend some time between Eclipses recovering Astral Power before triggering Eclipse again._
        - Umbral Intensity has been updated – Solar Eclipse increases the damage of Wrath by an additional 10%. Lunar Eclipse increases the damage of Starfire by 10%.
        - Soul of the Forest has been updated – Solar Eclipse increases Wrath’s Astral Power generation by 50% and Lunar Eclipse increases Starfire’s Astral Power generation by 60%.

        - Starfire now deals 50% of primary target damage to nearby enemies (was 33%).
            - _Developers’ notes: There are no longer talents that modify this percentage. We weren’t happy with how “required” those talents could become for Starfire area-of-effect damage and when it was right to take them or not._
        - Orbital Bombardment’s Stellar Flare damage increased by 30%.
        - Cosmic Rapidity no longer affects Stellar Flare.
        - Eclipses no longer apply activation overlays to Wrath and Starfire on your action bars.
            - _Developers’ notes: With the Cooldown Manager making it easier to see what Eclipse you’re in, we’re testing removing these to reduce the number of ability glows you can have active at once._
        - Torghast Ability: Leaf on the Water has been updated – Now reduces the cooldown of Solar Eclipse and Lunar Eclipse by 2 seconds.
        - Several talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Astral Smolder

            - Waning Twilight
            - Warrior of Elune
    - **Feral**
        - _Developers’ notes: Feral Druid is changing in Midnight to address some important mechanics that are based on information that is hidden to the player. Bleed snapshotting, where the damage a bleed deals is increased for its entire duration, is now applied only by Tiger’s Fury and Prowl. The icons of empowered bleeds change to show they’re strengthened. Bloodtalons has been removed. These changes also aim to reduce the complexity that could go into choosing the best builder to use in the moment, putting more of Ferals’ focus on maintaining bleeds and building and spending combo points._ _While some abilities like Brutal Slash and Adaptive Swarm have been removed, Feral has gained some new tricks that lean into their flavor as deadly hunting cats. Frantic Frenzy is a multi-target upgrade to Feral Frenzy and Blood Spattered makes them even stronger at taking down a primary target while fighting many enemies._
        - Apex Talents: Unseen Predator
            - When you Ferocious Bite, you have a 75% chance to flicker to a nearby enemy and deliver an Unseen Attack.

        - Sudden Ambush has been updated – Finishing moves have a 4% chance per combo point spent to guarantee your next Rake, Shred, or Swipe critically strikes all targets.
            - _Developers’ notes: This retains the increased damage and extra combo points without snapshotting._
        - Ashamane’s Guidance has been updated – Now reduces the cooldown of Incarnation: Avatar of Ashamane by 30 seconds.
        - Druid of the Claw: Tear Down the Mighty has been updated – No longer reduces the cooldown of Feral Frenzy. Instead, damage dealt by Chomp increased by 20%.

        - Omen of Clarity no longer effects Thrash, only Shred and Swipe.

        - Rampant Ferocity now damages all nearby targets, not only those afflicted by Rip.
        - Saber Jaws now increases the extra damage from spending extra Energy on Ferocious Bite by 50% (was 60%). This does not affect PvP combat.
        - Apex Predator triggers less often with a single Rip active and triggers more often when multiple Rips are active.
            - _Developers’ notes: This is a continuing effort to make Apex Predator targeted more at area-of-effect and funnel damage scenarios. It should be good on bosses, but you might take other talents in pure single target._
        - Many talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
        - Berserk: Heart of the Lion icon changed.
        - The following talents have been removed:

            - Lion’s Strength
            - Unbridled Swarm
    - **Guardian**
        - _Developers’ notes:_ Guardian Druid’s Rage economy is very oversaturated, particularly during cooldowns and in multi-target contexts, resulting in excessive APM and unintuitive resource management. We’re aiming to smooth out Rage income and provide healthier outlets. Additionally, we’re pulling back in areas where survivability feels contingent on having multiple layers of defensives, and improving a smaller set of baseline abilities instead.
        - Apex Talents will be available for testing in a future build.
        - New Talent: Gift of an Ancient Guardian – Ironfur increases your Mastery by 5%.
        - New Talent: Ward of the Forest – Barkskin increases your maximum health by 20%, but its duration is reduced by 40%.

        - New Talent: Sundering Roar – Roar with earthshattering ferocity, dealing Physical damage, resetting the cooldown of Thrash, and allowing it to stack 5 additional times for 12 seconds; when Sundering Roar ends, any excess stacks of Thrash immediately deal their remaining damage. 60 second cooldown.
        - New Talent: Waking Nightmare – Awaken memories of past conflicts, causing a Dread Shade to take form nearby. While active, shades slowly travel toward your target, dealing Nature damage to nearby enemies and mirroring your Thrash casts.
        - New Talent: Harnessed Rage – Mangle has 1 additional charge, and when Maul is cast at 80 Rage or above, its chance to activate Gore is increased by 100%.
        - New Talent: Front of the Pack – Stampeding Roar’s radius is increased by 30%, and your movement speed is increased by 5%.
        - New Talent: Memory of Ysera – Heal for 1% of your maximum health each time you spend 40 Rage.

            - Improved Survival Instincts
            - Thorns of Iron
    - **Restoration**
        - _Developers’ notes: We are significantly reducing the number of buffs Restoration Druid can apply to allies to make raid frames and target frames easy to parse and always show your important effects. Restoration Druid’s Mastery will also be much more effective per healing over time effect active, as they can now only apply up to 5 heal over time effects to allies. We are also streamlining several cooldowns and actives we felt were redundant with other tools in the kit by either removing them or combining them with other abilities. Finally, we are reducing the amount of maintenance buffs by making targeted changes to Lifebloom talents and offering a way to maintain Efflorescence automatically on your Lifebloom target._

        - Flourish has been redesigned – Now a passive talent that upgrades Tranquility, causing it to extend your heal over time effects by 2 seconds each time it heals. Available directly below Tranquility.
        - Wild Synthesis has been redesigned – Now increases the healing of Grove Guardians and Efflorescence by 35%.
        - Cultivation has been redesigned – Rejuvenation heals instantly for 21% Spell Power on targets below 60% health.

        - Mastery: Harmony now increases your healing by 11.4% per heal over time effect (was 6%). Note that this benefit falls off over time, and is most effective on your first heal over time.
        - Photosynthesis no longer causes Lifebloom to increase the healing rate of your spells by 10%. Chance to bloom increased to 8%.
        - Tranquility direct healing increased by 40% and no longer applies a heal over time effect to allies.

We are also increasing the base healing of Regrowth and Wild Growth to compensate for these changes._

        - Azure Strike damage increased by 50%.
        - Leaping Flames now changes the icon for Living Flame while active.
    - **Augmentation**
        - _Developers’ notes: The goal of these changes is to simplify Ebon Might targeting in raid environments. Since it now applies to all members of the raid, there is no need to micromanage who it should go on. There will still be some buff management gameplay with Prescience, which will continue to have a smart-targeting option for those who do not want to swap targets between enemies and allies frequently. Overall, this should make raid gameplay much smoother and similar to dungeon gameplay._
        - Apex Talents: Duplicate
            - Breath of Eons summons a version of you from the future to assist you in battle, lasting 20 seconds. Your duplicate casts Eruption, empower spells, and Living Flame.

    - **Devastation**
        - _Developers’ notes: Devastation is one of our simpler caster specializations and we feel most rotational spells and talents already align with our approachability goals. In Midnight, we’re removing Shattering Star and Firestorm and adding some fresh talents in their stead to continue to evolve gameplay, including a talent that allows Deep Breath to be used a second time. We’re also updating Flameshaper talents by removing Engulf and having the keystone grant an additional charge of Fire Breath with some gameplay around managing Fire Breath’s damage over time effect._
        - Apex Talents will be available for testing in a future build.
        - New Talent: Star Salvo – Increases Shattering Star damage by 35%. Shattering Stars are exhaled at all of your Eternity Surge targets.

        - New Talent: Second Exhale – Deep Breath deals 20% increased damage and can be cast again within 18 seconds of being used. Recall will be available after the second cast if talented. In PvP, Deep Breath damage is instead reduced by 20%.
        - Shattering Star has been redesigned as a passive called Shattering Stars – Eternity Surge releases a Shattering Star at your target that deals 50% more damage per empower level reached.
        - Honed Aggression has been redesigned – Increases the critical strike chance of your spells by 2%/4%.

            - Firestorm
            - Focusing Iris
            - Shattering Star
            - Snapfire
    - **Preservation**
        - _Developers’ notes: Preservation’s gameplay has always revolved around planning large healing moments and rotating a series of powerful cooldowns to deliver healing. We would like to simplify the planning gameplay by lowering the number of cooldowns they are juggling and by changing one of their largest healing combos - Lifebind. To compensate for lost power, their bread-and-butter healing spells will be more effective, particularly Emerald Blossom, Verdant Embrace, and Dream Breath. We are also making several quality-of-life adjustments: Dream Breath’s range is increased to 40 yards, Dream Flight now protects the Evoker while they are in flight, and Evokers now have the option to talent into a ranged version of Verdant Embrace. The end goal is that Preservation’s style of delivering healing is more intuitive and easier to pick up, while still being unique and Dragon-like._
        - Apex Talents: Merithra’s Blessing
            - Essence abilities have a chance to infuse your next Reversion with the power of the Green Dragonflight, upgrading it to Merithra’s Blessing.

        - Empath has been redesigned – Now functions with all empower spells.
        - Spiritual Clarity has been redesigned – Now reduces the cooldown of Dream Breath by 10 seconds.
        - All healing increased by 5%.

            - Spiritbloom
- **HUNTER**
    - **Hero Talents**
        - **Dark Ranger**
            - _Developers’ notes: Black Arrow provides an unusually high amount of damage relative to the rest of Marksmanship and Beast Mastery’s kits. In Midnight, we’re making some adjustments to ensure that Dark Ranger’s effects don’t completely overshadow the core abilities of Marksmanship and Beast Mastery._
            - New Talent: Corpsecaller
                - Marksmanship: Black Arrow’s periodic damage has a small chance to rouse the dead, summoning a Dark Minion to fight alongside you for 20 seconds.
                - Beast Mastery: When summoning a Dire Beast, you have a 10% chance to instead summon a Dark Hound.
            - New Talent: Wailing Dead – Bloodshed/Trueshot summons a Dark Hound/Dark Minion and replaces Bloodshed/Trueshot with Wailing Arrow.

            - Black Arrow has been updated – Periodic damage increased substantially and is no longer a rolling periodic.
                - _Developers’ notes: Making Black Arrow’s periodic effect a Rolling Periodic didn’t move the dial in terms of its power, so we’re opting to simplify it and increase its damage substantially. Our goal is to have Black Arrow’s periodic damage be a more potent area-of-effect tuning knob now that it can easily be mass-applied by Umbral Reach. Since it no longer is a rolling periodic, this won’t impact the power of the periodic effect in single target dramatically._
            - Soul Drinker has been updated – Now causes Kill Command and Barbed Shot to have a chance to grant Deathblow. Now causes Aimed Shot and Rapid Fire to have an increased chance to grant Deathblow.
            - Bleak Arrows has been updated – No longer has a chance to grant Deathblow. Now increases auto shot damage by 100%.
                - _Developers’ notes: In Midnight, we’d like the best way for you to generate Deathblow to be casting your core rotational spells, so we’re removing the proc from auto attacks and adding a new and stronger source via Soul Drinker._
            - Banshee’s Mark has been updated – Now increases the critical strike damage of Bleak Powder and Black Arrow by 10%. Choice node with the Bell Tolls.
            - The Bell Tolls has been updated – Now increases pet damage and Dire Beast damage for Beast Mastery. Increases crit chance and Dark Minion damage for Marksmanship.
                - _Developers’ notes: The Bell Tolls has not proven to be as reliable of a tuning knob as we’d like, so we’re simplifying and focusing its bonuses._
            - Phantom Pain has been removed.
            - **Beast Mastery**
                - Withering Fire has been updated – Now activates from Bloodshed for Beast Mastery. No longer periodically grants Deathblow for Beast Mastery.

            - Hogstrider has been updated – No longer affects Mongoose Bite or Raptor Strike. Now increases Hatchet Toss’s damage by 100% and causes it to strike 1 additional nearby target per stack, stacking up to 4 times.
            - Ursine Fury has been updated – When your Bear is summoned, it is joined by 2 Dire Beasts.
            - No Mercy has been updated – The damage your Bleed effects is increased by 20%.
            - Howl of the Pack Leader has been updated –
                - Boar now charges once per summon (was 3 times). Boar charge primary and secondary target damage increased by 300%.
                    - _Developers’ notes: Pack Leader, especially on Beast Mastery, creates a lot of visual noise in the world. By reducing how many charges the Boar does, we’re hoping to give some more room for the visuals/effects of your spec and hero talent to breathe while also making the Boar’s collision with your target more noticeable and impactful._
                - Bear base damage and stat scalings reduced by 40%.
                    - _Developers’ notes: The Pack Leader Bear will continue to be one of the more powerful Pack Leader summons, but we’d like to reduce its impact relative to the other Pack Leader summons._
            - Shell Cover has been updated – Survival of the Fittest now summons a Turtle to aid you, further increasing its damage reduction effect by 10%.
            - The following talents have been removed:
                - Envenomed Fangs
                - Lead from the Front
            - **Survival**
                - Dire Summons has been updated – Kill Command now reduces the cooldown of Howl of the Pack Leader by 1.5 seconds (was 2.5 seconds). Raptor Strike now reduces the cooldown by 1 second (was 1.5 seconds).
        - **Sentinel**
            - _Developers’ notes: Sentinel has been rebuilt and redesigned for Midnight. Our goals with this update were targeting the Keystone and Capstone, since that was where a majority of the tree’s complexity stemmed. This updated version of Sentinel should provide more active and directed gameplay, require substantially less tracking, be more deeply ingrained into the playstyles of Marksmanship and Survival, all while being less visually and audibly noisy._
            - New Talent: Moonlight Chakram – After casting Trueshot or Takedown, it is replaced with Moonlight Chakram for 15 seconds. Throw a chakram blessed with moonlight at your current target that will rapidly deal Physical damage 7 times, bouncing to other targets if they are nearby.
            - New Talent: Stalk and Strike – Throwing your Moonlight Chakram grants you Lock and Load/1 charge of Wildfire Bomb and has a 100% chance to apply Sentinel’s Mark. Choice node against Twilight Requiem.

            - New Talent: Moon’s Blessing – Consuming Precise Shots/Raptor Strike has a 10% increased chance to summon your Sentinel Owl. When your Sentinel Owl applies Sentinel’s Mark, reduce the cooldown of Aimed Shot/Wildfire Bomb by 2 seconds/6 seconds.
            - New Talent: Stargazer – Consuming Precise Shots/Casting Raptor Strike grants 2% critical strike damage for 10 seconds. Multiple applications may overlap. Choice node with Open Fire.

            - New Talent: Arcane Talons – Sentinel’s Mark further increases the damage of Aimed Shot/Wildfire Bomb by 10%/50%.
            - New Talent: Can’t Miss, Won’t Miss – Precise Shots/Raptor Strike damage bonus increased by 40%/25%. Trueshot/Takedown duration increased by 4 seconds/2 seconds.
            - New Talent: Sanctified Armaments – An additional 25%/15% of Rapid Fire/Raptor Strike’s damage is dealt as Arcane damage over 6 seconds.
            - New Talent: Conditioning – Your movement speed is increased by 8%. Aspect of the Cheetah’s cooldown is reduced by 60 seconds. Choice node with Scout’s Vigil.
            - New Talent: Scout’s Vigil – Enemy detection radius reduced by 10 yards. While in Camouflage, your stealth detection radius is increased by 25 yards.
            - New Talent: Lunar Calling
                - Marksmanship: Feathered Frenzy further increases your chance to summon your Sentinel Owl during Trueshot by 10%.
                - Survival: Takedown summons your Sentinel Owl. Your chance to summon your Sentinel Owl is increased by an additional 10% during Primal Frenzy.
            - Sentinel has been redesigned:
                - Marksmanship: Your Eagle is replaced with a Sentinel Owl that applies an enhanced Sentinel’s Mark. Sentinel’s Mark: Increases the damage taken from Aimed Shot by 30%.
                - Survival: Raptor Strike has a chance to summon the aid of a Sentinel Owl that descends from the skies and applies Sentinel’s Mark to your target. Sentinel’s Mark: Increases the damage taken from Wildfire Bomb by 80%.

            - Invigorating Pulse has been redesigned – Steady Shot/Kill Command grants an additional 5 Focus and its damage is increased by 20%. Maximum Focus increased by 25.
            - The following talents have been removed:
                - Catch Out
                - Crescent Steel
                - Extrapolated Shots
                - Eyes Closed
                - Kill Shot (moved to the Marksmanship talent tree)
                - Overwatch
                - Release and Reload
                - Sentinel Precision
                - Sentinel Watch
                - Sideline
                - Symphonic Arsenal
    - **Class**
        - Hunter’s Mark has been updated – Now increases the target’s damage taken by 3% (was 5% above 80% health).
            - _Developers’ notes: We’d like Hunter’s Mark to be more broadly appealing and easier to use, so we’re simplifying its effect and buffing it._
    - **Beast Mastery**
        - _Developers’ notes: Beast Mastery Hunters have a fantasy of consistent, reliable, and powerful pet-sourced attacks, and that’s something we’re looking to lean into as we move into Midnight. We’re reducing the number of conditionals, auras, and modifiers on Barbed Shot to make it more easy to spend as its available. We’ve grown fond of Bestial Wrath’s shorter cooldown, and as such are removing Barbed Wrath’s dynamic cooldown reduction effect to instead give Bestial Wrath a flat cooldown of 30 seconds when fully talented. Multi-Shot has had an odd place in Beast Mastery’s kit, so we’re giving it an update, causing it to be replaced in the Beast Mastery spec tree with a new pet-sourced attack that deals substantial damage in AOE while also activating effects like Beast Cleave and Kill Cleave. We hope this new spell will feel powerful and contribute meaningfully to your area damage. Bloodshed and Call of the Wild felt like they were both competing for a similar role of a cooldown that summoned a few more units to fight for you. As such, we removed Call of the Wild and are focusing on Bloodshed as a cooldown to get a few extra beasts to attack your enemies. With the change to make Kill Shot a Marksmanship only ability, Dark Rangers will now learn Black Arrow as a separate ability if they choose that Hero Talent tree._
        - Apex Talents will be available for testing in a future build.
        - New Talent: The Beast Within – Reduces the cooldown of Bestial Wrath by 30/60 seconds.
        - New Talent: Wild Thrash – Commands your pet(s) to attack all enemies near them. 8 second cooldown.
        - New Talent: Frenzy – Increases pet attack speed by 30/60%.
        - New Talent: Jagged Wounds – All bleed damage dealt by you and your pets increased by 10%.
        - Thrill of the Hunt has been redesigned – Critical strike chance increased by 2/4%.
        - Training Expert has been redesigned – Now increases pet damage by 2/4%.
        - Brutal Companion has been redesigned – Barbed Shot has a 25% chance to cause your pet to use its special attack and deal 50% bonus damage.
        - Thundering Hooves has been redesigned – Stomp damage increased by 30%. Bestial Wrath commands all active pets to Stomp at 200% effectiveness.
        - Serpentine Strikes has been redesigned – Now increases the critical damage of Cobra Shot by 50%.
        - Bloody Frenzy has been redesigned – When you use Bloodshed, your Barbed Shot damage over time happens 100% faster for 12 seconds.
        - Wild Instincts has been redesigned – Whenever your primary pet (and only your primary pet) uses Stomp, you will fire a free Barbed Shot at a target not already affected by Barbed Shot. This Barbed Shot cannot cause another Stomp.
        - Barbed Shot has been updated – Barbed Shot’s bleed is now a rolling periodic.
        - Dire Frenzy has been updated – Now increases Dire Beast damage by 10/20% (was 30/60%).
        - War Orders has been updated – Now has a 100% chance to reset the cooldown of Kill Command.
        - Kill Command damage increased by 50%.
        - Beast Cleave duration increased to 8 seconds.
        - Beast Cleave now activates when you use Wild Thrash, rather than from Multi-Shot.
        - Bestial Wrath initial damage increased substantially and now increases player and pet damage by 20% (was 30%).
        - Scent of Blood is no longer a 2-point node.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Barbed Wrath
            - Hunter’s Prey
            - Multi-Shot
            - Poisoned Barbs
            - Serpentine Rhythm
            - Wild Call
    - **Marksmanship**
        - _Developers’ notes: We are generally pleased with the state of Marksmanship after their Undermine(d) and Ghosts of K’aresh updates, but there were a few bigger things we’d like to address as we move into Midnight. Most notably, the introduction of Streamline as a core mechanic for Marksmanship inflated the amount of cast time reduction Marksmanship Hunters have access to while also contributing an extra aura to track. Aimed Shot is meant to be a long cast that is worth the wait. As its cast time reduces, so too must its damage, and we feel that flies in the face of what Aimed Shot should be about– as such we’ll be removing Streamline and increasing Aimed Shot’s damage. While Explosive Shot found a home as a guaranteed way to gain Lock and Load in Ghosts of K’aresh, we feel that it’s healthier for the spec as a whole to distance itself from Explosive Shot and instead focus on the more fantasy-forward spells like Volley and Kill Shot– spells that more often than not are competing with it in your rotational priorities. Speaking of Kill Shot, we are removing it from the Hunter class tree and letting Marksmanship fully own the execute niche it provides. Trueshot is gaining some cooldown reduction, cast time reduction, and focus cost reduction to compensate for the removal of Streamline._
        - Apex Talents will be available for testing in a future build.
        - New Talent: Deathblow – Aimed Shot has a 20% chance to reset the cooldown of Kill Shot and cause your next cast to be usable on any target regardless of their current health.
        - New Talent: Lethality – Critical damage dealt by your abilities and auto attacks is increased by 5%/10%.
        - Shrapnel Shot has been updated – Now grants Lock and Load when you Volley.
        - Aspect of the Hydra has been updated – Now also includes Kill Shot/Black Arrow.
        - Tensile Bowstring has been updated – No longer extends Trueshot. Now reduces the cast time and Focus cost of Aimed Shot during Trueshot.
        - Bullet Hell has been updated – Now reduces the cooldown of Volley by 15 seconds.
        - On Target has been updated – Now grants 2% increased Haste (was short duration Haste every time you consumed Spotter’s Mark).
        - Penetrating Shots has been updated – Crit damage bonus reduced to 25% of critical strike chance (was 40%).
        - Master Marksman has been updated – Now causes targets to bleed for 10% of the damage of a critical strike (was 15%).
            - _Developers’ notes: Marksmanship likes critical strike a bit too much, so we’re bringing it in slightly. We fully expect critical strike to remain a chase and powerful stat for Marksmanship after these adjustments._
        - Aimed Shot damage increased by 50%. Does not affect PvP combat.
        - Bullet Hell is now on a choice node with Shrapnel Shot.
        - Trueshot’s tooltip has been updated to better reflect the various bonuses provided by its talents.
        - Salvo’s tooltip has been updated to communicate the effects of Explosive Shot.
        - Fixed an issue causing Unmatched Precision to grant more damage than intended to Kill Shot and Black Arrow.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Double Tap
            - Improved Deathblow
            - Improved Streamline
            - Moving Target
            - Razor Fragments
            - Streamline
            - Tactical Reload
    - **Survival**
        - _Developers’ notes: As we head into Midnight, we’re continuing to refine and focus Survival Hunter’s fantasy, giving clearer playstyle, gameplay, and visual direction. Over the course of Alpha, we’ll be reintroducing one-handers into Survival Hunter’s pool of available weapons, which means we’ll also be looking to distance Survival from its spear-only identity that it’s had since Legion. We’ll be doubling down on Survival’s relationship with its pet with new talents that create an interdependency between the Hunter’s damage and their pet’s damage. Additionally, we’re leaning into the rugged, crafty, and bomb-centric fantasy we explored in The War Within with a new Fire grenade called Flamefang Pitch, a new visual and fantasy identity for Fury of the Eagle called Boomstick, and a host of new Wildfire Bomb talents and synergies.  
            Survival Hunter had a substantial number of abilities that were competing for your attention at any given time. Coordinated Assault and Flanking Strike have been combined into a new burst cooldown called Takedown that strives to take the best parts of both spells and blend them into one moment. We also made the tough decision to redesign Mongoose Bite. We feel confident that simplifying Mongoose Bite will allow us to carve out more interesting design space for Survival both now and in the future.  
            Lastly, in Midnight, we’d like Survival Hunter’s area damage to come from their explosives: Wildfire Bomb, Boomstick, and Flamefang Pitch, and as such we’re removing Butchery and its associated effects. We expect Raptor Swipe (Survival Hunter’s Apex Talent) to provide meaningful and exciting moments of AOE in between your chunky explosive spells._
        - Apex Talents: Raptor Swipe
            - Raptor Strike has a 25% chance to trigger a Raptor Swipe, dealing moderate physical damage to up to 5 nearby enemies and grant you 15 Focus.

            - Raptor Swipes cause your pet to lash out, dealing heavy single target damage to your main target and granting you 3% increased Haste for 10 seconds. Multiple applications may overlap.
        - Survival hunters are now able to dual wield one-handed axes, swords, and daggers.
        - New Ability: Hatchet Toss – Throw an axe at your target dealing moderate damage. 40 yard range. 30 Focus cost. Replaces Arcane Shot upon specializing into Survival Hunter.
        - New Talent: Strike as One – Your damaging abilities provoke your pet to attack, dealing light Physical damage.
        - New Talent: Takedown – You and your pet leap to your target and strike as one, dealing heavy physical damage to your target. For the next 8 seconds, the damage dealt by you and your pet is increased by 20%. Generates 50 Focus. 1.5 minute cooldown.
        - New Talent: Savagery – Takedown cooldown reduced by 15/30 seconds.
        - New Talent: Shower of Blood – Your bleed effects deal 8/16% increased damage.
        - New Talent: Two Against Many – Strike as One damages 2 additional enemies and its damage is increased by 15% for each enemy it strikes.
        - New Talent: Mongoose Fury – Raptor Strike increases the damage of Raptor Strike by 10% for 8 seconds. Multiple applications may overlap.
            - _Developers’ notes: In Midnight, we’re looking to distance Survival from the demands and cognitive load of Mongoose Bite/Mongoose Fury and move that complexity into new and more exciting parts of their kit. The unique animations for Mongoose Bite have been preserved with this change._
        - New Talent: Shrapnel Bomb – Wildfire Bomb’s periodic effect is now a Bleed. Choice node with Flamebreak.
        - New Talent: Flamebreak – All fire damage dealt is increased by 15%. Choice node with Shrapnel Bomb.
        - New Talent: Flamefang Pitch – Toss a fiery concoction that explodes violently upon reaching its destination, dealing heavy Fire damage to enemies in its area. After landing, your Flamefang Pitch ignites nearby terrain, dealing moderate damage to enemies in its area over 8 seconds.
        - New Talent: Wildfire Imbuement – Throwing your Flamefang Pitch imbues your weapon with flame, causing you and your pet’s damaging attacks and abilities to deal additional Fire damage for 10 seconds.
        - New Talent: Wallop – Gaining a stack of Mongoose Fury has a 20% chance to increase the damage of your next Raptor Strike by 50%. Choice node with Bloody Claws.
        - New Talent: Boomstick – Unload a series of 4 shotgun blasts in front of you, dealing heavy Physical damage over 3 seconds. Deals reduced damage beyond 8 targets.
            - _Developers’ notes: In Midnight, we’re reintroducing one-handed weapons to Survival Hunters and distancing Survival from its spear-only identity. As such, we’re updating Fury of the Eagle to better match this new direction for Survival Hunters._
        - New Talent: Shellshock – Your Boomstick’s damage is increased by 40% when striking a single target. Each additional target reduces this bonus by 8%.

        - New Talent: Wildfire Tar – Wildfire Bomb now deals its periodic damage over 6 additional seconds. Enemies affected by your Wildfire Bomb’s periodic damage take 15% increased damage from your pet.
        - New Talent: Sticky Bombs – When Wildfire Bomb explodes, it leaves behind a sticky bomb on its primary target, exploding for moderate Fire damage after a short delay. Damage reduced beyond 8 targets.
        - New Talent: Bonding – Mastery increased by 3%. You gain 5% increased Mastery from all Mastery sources.
        - Guerilla Tactics has been updated – Now increases initial explosion damage by 15% (was 50%).
            - _Developers’ notes: We’re reducing the giant modifier on this talent and baking it into the spell baseline._
        - Flanked has been updated – Now causes Takedown to strike 4 additional nearby targets, deal 50% increased damage, and increases your attack speed by 100% for its duration.
        - Bloody Claws has been updated – Each stack of Mongoose Fury also increases the damage of Strike as One by 10%. Choice node with Wallop.
        - Lunge has been updated – Wildfire Bomb cooldown reduction reduced to 0.5 seconds (was 1 second).

        - Kill Command no longer has a cooldown.
        - Improved Wildfire Bomb is now a 2-point node.
        - The following talents have been removed:

            - Bombardier
            - Born to Kill

- **MAGE**
    - **Hero Talents**
        - **Frostfire**
            - _Developers’ notes: The Frostfire Hero Talent tree added many auras, most of which you were incentivized to track and play around. It was also filled with damage procs, many new damage events, and provided an influx of Brain Freeze and Phoenix Flames charges to Frost and Fire respectively. In Midnight, we’re reworking the Frostfire Tree completely to let its gameplay more directly enhance and elevate the gameplay that exists within the Fire and Frost trees instead of overwhelming it. We’ve also moved Isothermic Core to the capstone location and integrated it more deeply into the tree’s talents, since the community has made it very clear that it is a fantastic visual spectacle and an exciting moment gameplay-wise. In Midnight, Frostfire Mages should have more intuitive rotational priorities, less auras to track, and punchy, big moments of damage and excitement with Frostfire Empowerment and Isothermic Core._
            - New Talent: Duality
                - Frost: Casting Glacial Spike also casts a Pyroblast, dealing moderate Fire damage.

            - New Talent: Molten Chill
                - Frost: Your Frostfire spells apply Ignite, dealing an additional 15% of their damage over 9 seconds.

            - New Talent: Dualcasting Adept – Your Frost/Fire spells deal 20% increased critical strike damage. Pyroblast and Flamestrike/Ice Lance and Blizzard damage increased by 10%.
            - New Talent: Blast Radius – Comet Storm damage increased by 20%. Meteor damage increased by 20%.
            - Frostfire Infusion has been updated –

            - Flame and Frost has been updated – Now triggers from Ice Block and Ice Cold for Frost Mages (was Cold Snap).
            - Isothermic Core Meteor and Comet Storm damage increased by 35%. Now the Frostfire capstone talent.

            - Frostfire Bolt initial and periodic damage increased by 50%.
            - Frostfire Bolt keystone now has two specialization specific versions that only can be seen and selected by Frost or Fire. They now override only Frostbolt or Fireball based on your specialization.
                - _Developers’ notes: This will fix situations where Fire Mages would have Frostfire Bolt revert to Frostbolt when talenting out of Frostfire Hero Talents._
            - The following talents have been removed:
                - Excess Fire
                - Excess Frost
                - Frostfire Mastery
        - **Spellslinger**
            - New Talent: Attuned Familiar – Your Arcane Familiar/Water Elemental has a 50% chance to conjure a Splinter alongside its Arcane Assault/Waterbolt.
            - New Talent: Infused Splinters – Direct damage from Splinters has a 25% chance to grant 1 stack of Arcane Salvo/apply 1 stack of Freezing.
            - New Talent: Polished Focus – Casting Arcane Barrage while at 20 or more Arcane Salvo stacks refunds 5 Arcane Salvo stacks/Ice Lance consumes 1 additional stack of Freezing.
            - Look Again has been redesigned – While in combat, Blink summons a Mirror Image at your previous location.

            - Force of Will has been updated –

            - Signature Spell has been updated – Casting Touch of the Magi conjures 4 Arcane Splinters. Casting Glacial Spike conjures 2 Frost Splinters.

            - New Talent: Time Twist – The cooldown of Alter Time is reduced by 10 seconds. Choice node with Merely a Setback.
            - Codex of the Sunstriders has been redesigned – When your Arcane Phoenix is summoned, it consumes all your Spellfire Spheres. Each Sphere consumed increases your spell damage during Arcane Surge/Combustion by 2% and causes your Arcane Phoenix to cast an exceptional Arcane or Fire spell over its duration.
                - _Developers’ notes: We’re focusing the effects of Codex of the Sunstriders and Memory of Al’ar to make them easier to understand, create more immediate impact, and reduce the number of auras present in the Sunfury tree._
            - Merely a Setback has been redesigned – The bonuses provided by your Barrier spells persist an additional 8 seconds after your Barrier is removed. Additionally, Cauterize no longer deals damage to you.
            - Glorious Incandescence has been updated – Now granted upon generating a Spellfire Sphere. No longer causes Fire Blast to hit additional targets. Tooltip updated to better reflect the damage value of Meteorites.
            - Memory of Al’ar has been updated – No longer extends the duration of Arcane Soul or Hyperthermia based on the number of exceptional spells cast. Base duration of Arcane Soul and Hyperthermia increased to 6 seconds (was 2 seconds).

    - **Class**
        - _Developers’ notes: We’re taking a pass to reduce button and aura bloat in the Mage core tree. We’re also consolidating defensive power to simplify the landscape of Mage defensives and make them more approachable. In Midnight, Barrier spells should be potent, consistent, and reliable. Mirror Image and Invisibility spells should now be able to be used for their utility instead of tacked on defensive benefits. We’re also removing Shifting Power. Shifting Power was uniquely powerful for Fire Mage and substantially less interesting for Arcane and Frost but it came with its own set of tuning challenges that made it difficult to balance their cooldowns appropriately with its existence. Fire Mage will be getting some spec-specific adjustments to make Fire Blast more accessible to compensate for the loss of Shifting Power. We’re also reducing Shimmer’s power to help make the decision between Blink and Shimmer feel like more of a meaningful choice. Players who want to maximize uptime and display mastery over an encounter and its mechanics should feel empowered to express that through Shimmer, whereas progression and more reactive Mages should enjoy the increased availability of Blink._
        - New Talent: Improved Conjuration – Mirror Image’s cooldown is reduced by 30/60 seconds.
        - New Talent: Time Walk – Alter Time resets the cooldown of Blink and Shimmer when you return to your original location. Choice node with Temporal Realignment.

        - New Talent: Charm of Medivh – Mastery increased by 3%.

            - Temporal Velocity
            - Volatile Destruction
    - **Arcane**
        - _Developers’ notes: In Midnight, our biggest goal with Arcane is simplifying the decision-making around when to Arcane Barrage by reducing the number of effects and folding the remaining ones into a new resource called Arcane Salvo. Arcane Mages can talent into different ways to generate Arcane Salvo and should expect their Hero Talents to provide some unique behaviors that might augment their cadence of Arcane Barrage drastically. We’re also removing all effects that refund Arcane Charges when you Barrage while adding some new and unique ways to regain charges throughout the tree to help reinforce the Arcane Charge climb as a core part of the Arcane Mage experience. Lastly, we’re introducing a new area damage spell called Arcane Pulse that will replace Arcane Explosion when learned. This spell features a 40 yard range, ramping damage, mana cost, and area effect per arcane charge, and should feel like an intuitive and powerful option when doing rotational filler in AOE._
        - Apex Talents: Touch of the Archmage
            - Touch of the Magi accumulates an additional 5% damage and has 1 additional charge.
            - Arcane Charges further increase the damage of Arcane Blast, Arcane Pulse, and Arcane Barrage by 15/30%.

        - New Talent: Arcane Salvo – Casting a damaging spell increases the damage of Arcane Barrage by 3%, up to 60%.
        - New Talent: Focusing Crystal – Each wave of Arcane Missiles grants 1 Arcane Salvo stack; Arcane Missiles damage increased by 15%.
        - New Talent: Arcane Singularity – Arcane Salvo damage bonus increased by 2%.

        - New Talent: Aegwynn’s Technique – Casting Touch of the Magi grants Clearcasting. Choice node with Arcane Echo.
        - New Talent: Overflowing Insight – Arcane Blast and Arcane Pulse deal 15% increased damage but their mana costs are increased by 25%.
        - New Talent: Expanded Mind – Gain 1 additional stack of Arcane Salvo from casting a damaging spell.
        - New Talent: Electrostatic Orb – Arcane Orb has a 50%/100% chance to grant a stack of Arcane Salvo, up to 5 times.
        - Aether Attunement has been updated – Now a 2-point talent. Arcane Missiles hits 2/4 additional targets at 50% effectiveness.

            - Static Cloud
            - Time Loop
    - **Fire**
        - _Developers’ notes: With the reintroduction of Phoenix Flames and the addition of Hero Talents, Fire Mages have had an easier and easier time generating Hot Streak. This impacts the tuning of Pyroblast and Flamestrike and the pace of Fire’s combat in extreme ways. In Midnight, we are heavily increasing the damage of Fire Mage’s premier damaging spells like Pyroblast, Flamestrike, and Meteor while reducing their access to guaranteed crits by removing Phoenix Flames. We’re also changing Kindling to be a flat cooldown reduction on Combustion to reduce how punishing imperfect uptime can be. We’re increasing the cost in the Fire talent tree to access Ignite spreading functionality to help make the Ignite spread playstyle more distinct from Fire’s other builds and damage profiles and also make it easier to tune around. In Midnight, Fire Mages should be casting Fireball more often, and in exchange, will see significantly increased damage coming from their Hot Streak consumers, Meteors, and Combustion windows._
        - Apex Talents: Fired Up
            - While Combustion is active, consuming Hot Streak has a 15% chance to grant you Fired Up, increasing your Fire damage by 5% until Combustion ends.
            - Gaining Fired Up reduces the cooldown of Fire Blast by 2.5 seconds/5 seconds.
            - Consuming Hot Streak has a 15% increased chance of granting you Fired Up. Additionally Fired Up now extends Combustion’s duration by 1 second.
        - New Talent: Ignition – Fire Blast now spreads 100% of your target’s Ignite to 1 nearby enemy. Flamestrike applies 50% more Ignite.
        - New Talent: Slow Burn – Combustion grants mastery equal to 75% of your Critical Strike stat. Combustion causes your spells to apply Ignite at 15% increased effectiveness.
        - New Talent: Burn It All – Grants you 10% increased spell damage plus an additional 20% of your critical strike chance as spell damage.
        - New Talent: Frenetic Speed – When Fireball damages an enemy below 30% health, you gain 30% movement speed for 3 seconds.
        - New Talent: Pyroclasm – Consuming Hot Streak has a 15% chance to make your next non-instant Pyroblast or Flamestrike cast within 15 seconds to deal 230% increased damage. Stacks up to 2 times.
        - New Talent: Cinderstorm - Casting Pyroblast or Flamestrike has a 8% chance to summon a storm of 5 cinders that pursue your target. Upon reaching your target, each cinder deals moderate Fire damage, applies Ignite at 100% effectiveness, and spreads 50% of your Ignite to up to 1 nearby target.
        - Mastery: Ignite has been updated – Effectiveness reduced by 25% and no longer causes Fire Blast to spread Ignite baseline.
            - _Developers’ notes: Ignite-spreading as a baseline functionality for Fire has proven to be too powerful and very cheap to acquire in the talent tree. Rather than remove the ability to spread Ignite or heavily nerf the playstyle, we’re instead going to be asking players to rebuy some of the power in the talent tree to present more opportunity cost across builds and ensure the two playstyles feel distinct._
        - Fuel the Fire has been updated – Now additionally causes Flamestrike to deal 5% increased damage for each enemy it damages, up to 25%.
        - Flame On has been updated – Now a 2-point talent. Grants 1 charge/2 charges of Fire Blast.
        - Critical Mass has been updated – Now grants 4%/8% increased chance to deal a critical strike. You gain 10/20% more critical strike stat from all sources.
        - Molten Fury has been updated – Now grants 15% increased damage on enemies below 30% health (was 7%).
            - _Developers’ notes: We’d like to better lean into Fire’s execute niche in Midnight._
        - Scorch has been updated – Now passive. When Fireball damages an enemy below 30% health it always critically strikes.
            - _Developers’ notes: Scorch and Fireball were constantly competing for the same spot in Fire’s rotation as your casted filler. By removing Scorch we aim to reduce a keybind and a point of confusion. The cast while moving benefit of Scorch significantly creeped Fire’s mobility relative to other casters, which we’re also looking to correct._
        - Flame Accelerant has been updated – Now reduces Pyroblast and Flamestrike cast time by 20%.
        - Inflame has been updated – Ignite bonus increased to 25% (was 10%).
        - Kindling has been updated – Now reduces Combustion’s cooldown by 30 seconds.
            - _Developers’ notes: Kindling was one of many effects that heavily punished Fire Mages for losing uptime, which could snowball heavily into less Combustions and less damage over an encounter._
        - Scald has been updated – When Fireball damages an enemy below 30% health, it deals 50% increased damage.
        - Feel the Burn has been updated – Now grants 4% Mastery per stack and each stack has its own duration. Multiple applications may overlap and it no longer has a stack cap. Duration increased to 8 seconds (was 6 seconds).

        - Blast Zone has been updated – Flamestrike and Meteor deal 10% increased damage.
        - Controlled Destruction has been updated – Now triggers from Ignite damage (was Pyroblast and Fireball).
        - Master of Flame has been updated – No longer increases the number of targets Ignite spreads to during Combustion. No longer increases Fireball’s damage.
        - From the Ashes has been updated – Fire Blast damage increased by 15%. Your direct-damage spells reduce the cooldown of Fire Blast by 0.5 seconds.
        - Surging Blaze has been updated – Now increases Pyroblast and Flamestrike damage by 8%. No longer reduces cast times of either spell.
        - Flame Patch has been updated – Damage increased by 200% and duration reduced to 6 seconds (was 8 seconds). Now applies Ignite. Enemies can no longer be damaged by multiple Flame Patches at once. Instead, nearby Flame Patches will unify into one larger Flame Patch.
        - Fireball now replaces Frostbolt upon activating the Fire Mage specialization.
        - Fireball damage increased by 100%. Damage unchanged in PvP.
        - Flamestrike, Fuel the Fire, and Cauterize are now located in the talent tree (was learned automatically when specialized as Fire).
        - Flamestrike damage increased by 70% and no longer slows affected enemies by 20%.
        - Flamestrike now has a unit-targeted variant accessible via a choice node on Flamestrike.
        - Meteor direct damage increased by 25% and its damage over time increased by 200%.
        - Pyroblast damage increased by 45%.
        - Cauterize cooldown increased to 6 minutes (was 5 minutes).
            - _Developers’ notes: We’d like to bring Cauterize more in line with existing cheat death effects._
        - Intensifying Flame is now correctly treated as a periodic effect.
        - Combustion’s tooltip and aura tooltip have been updated to better reflect its various bonuses.
        - Intensifying Flame damage bonus increased to 30% (was 20%).
        - Firestarter is now a choice node with Scorch.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Alexstrasza’s Fury

            - Sparking Cinders
            - Sun King’s Blessing
            - Unleashed Inferno
    - **Frost**
        - _Developers’ notes: Frost Mage is receiving a gameplay overhaul in Midnight targeted at simplifying their rotation by removing competing spell priorities and giving each spell a much clearer place in Frost’s rotation. In Midnight, Frost Mage features building and spending debuff gameplay centered around two reimagined mechanics: Freezing and Shattering. Frostbolt and Flurry apply stacks of Freezing and Ice Lance consumes them to deal significant bonus damage. Alongside this core mechanical change, we’re doing an overhaul of Frost’s talent tree targeted at reducing button bloat, reinforcing rotational clarity and priorities, while also removing a significant number of auras. One such change is the removal of Icy Veins as Frost Mage’s burst cooldown, now being replaced with Ray of Frost. Our vision for Frost Mage in Midnight involves a consistent damage profile with smaller peaks relative to the burstier specializations of Arcane and Fire, but a higher consistent damage output. We feel that Frost Mage has historically been deemed as the more approachable of the 3 mage specs and we like that for Frost’s identity, Our goal for the rework is for that perception to continue while also offering new Mastery for those players who heavily invest in playing Frost._
        - Apex Talents: Hand of Frost
            - Shattering an enemy has a 10% chance to summon a Hand of Frost to pursue your target. Upon reaching your target, it explodes, dealing moderate Frost damage to its target and applying 2 stacks of Freezing.
            - Each stack of Freezing you Shatter increases your chance to summon a Hand of Frost by 1%/2%. Damage from Hand of Frost increases your spell damage by 2/4% for 8 seconds. Multiple applications may overlap.

    - **Brewmaster**
        - _Developers’ notes: Brewmaster’s kit contains a number of very niche cooldowns and abilities, as well as a number of talents which have a highly-transformative impact on gameplay. In aggregate these can cause the specialization to be difficult to learn, especially in combination with developing intuition surrounding Stagger. We are aiming to broaden some of these niches while narrowing the impact of transformational talents. In addition, some abilities have been removed in order to better concentrate both power and gameplay focus on a more manageable core.

Way of the Crane and Way of the Serpent is a new choice node worth highlighting as well, which is something new we’re trying to highlight different aspects of Mistweaver’s toolkit in particular, based on a player’s preferred playstyle. Our hope is that both options have relevant situations in which they are useful and therefore encourage solid build diversity between content and also a player’s individual preferences._

We are also reducing the amount of mid-range cooldowns they have access to as we felt there were a few too many in that space and making sure Aura Mastery is a satisfying and impactful button press instead. Light of Dawn is also getting an update to its targeting, now being a circular radius around the paladin rather than a frontal cone. Getting the perfect angle for Light of Dawn could sometimes be difficult, and we don’t feel like it matched our combat approachability goals._
        - Apex Talents: Beacon of the Savior
            - While in combat, apply a Beacon of the Savior to the lowest health ally within 30 yards that causes your direct healing on others to also heal that ally for 30% of the amount healed.

            - Beacon of the Savior transfers an additional 10%/20% of the amount healed.

    - **Protection**
        - _Developers’ notes: We’re addressing some pain points Protection Paladin has been experiencing at the start of combat with competing priorities and abilities clashing. Protection Paladins were subject to significant pressure and tension between defensive abilities, Holy Power generation, generating and maintaining threat, and an immediate need to place Consecration. We are also aiming to streamline by paring back on the number of layers of short-duration or low-impact defensive abilities in order to concentrate power into fewer moving parts._

            - Inmost Light
            - Moment of Glory
    - **Retribution**
        - _Developers’ notes: As we head into Midnight, we’re taking a close look at a couple of things such as how Retribution Paladin generates Holy Power, the amount of spells needed to cast for setup, the Hero Talent balance and the design of the third gate in the spec tree.  
            Currently, we feel the choices in the 3rd gate are too limiting, forcing players to pick between single-target and AoE effectiveness with little flexibility. To address this, we’re redesigning some abilities while removing some others. The most impactful change here happening with Execution Sentence and Final Reckoning. In Midnight, we’ve decided to combine these two abilities into one powerful ability that is useful both in AoE and in single target situations.  
            For Holy Power generation, we’re looking into the amount of passive over time effects. A key focus here is Crusading Strikes. While it has served Retribution very well in some areas, over time it has become an invisible, passive Holy Power generator that’s difficult to track and lacks meaningful interaction. We’re shifting emphasis toward Templar Strikes. Another important change will be coming to Divine Resonance, with the aim of giving players more agency and clarity in their Holy Power generation.  
            Going back to the amount of spell casts, one change we would like to address is Divine Hammer. We know many enjoyed its interactions with the Templar Hero Talents. But on the other hand, many found it stressful to manage on top of other abilities such as Execution Sentence. In Midnight, with approachability in mind, we decided to find a different place for Divine Hammer inside the Templar Hero Talent tree as a key AoE component. This change will allow us to be more flexible with the tuning of Empyrean Hammers and Hammer of Light and find a healthier balance between Herald of the Sun and Templar Hero talent trees.  
            We’re also exploring ways to make Art of War and Righteous Cause feel more impactful and distinct, while shifting more power back into Holy Power spenders like Final Verdict and Divine Storm to reinforce their importance in the rotation._
        - Apex Talents: Light Within
            - Art of War or Righteous Cause increases the damage of your next Blade of Justice by 150%. Avenging Wrath grants you Art of War or Righteous Cause.

        - Divine Resonance has been updated – Divine Toll causes your next 3 Judgments to cast again at 100% effectiveness.

            - Void Shift
            - Word of the Pious
    - **Discipline**
        - _Developers’ notes: The primary aim of these changes is to consolidate and remove cooldowns and damage/healing modifiers to make base spell casts feel strong. With removing Schism, Shadow Covenant, and several supporting talents, we can focus on Mind Blast, Penance, and Shadow Word: Pain dealing solid consistent damage, so you can access chunky burst healing on a more consistent cadence. Evangelism has also been redesigned as a way to quickly apply Atonements to allies in raids, providing a much snappier way to ramp up your area of effect healing. The result should be a smoother gameplay experience that requires a little less planning and aura tracking, but still retains depth._
        - Apex Talents: Master the Darkness
            - Penance has a high chance to upgrade Power Word: Shield into Void Shield, causing it to absorb additional damage and apply to 3 nearby allies.

        - New Talent: Shadow Mend – Shadow Word: Pain damage has a chance to upgrade your next Flash Heal to Shadow Mend, which heals an ally for 1100% spell power, but at a price.
        - New Talent: Greater Smite – Casting Smite increases the casting speed and damage of your next Smite by 20%, stacking 2 times. Lasts 2 seconds.
        - New Talent: Inner Light and Shadow (was a PvP talent) –
            - Inner Light: Healing spells cost 10% less mana.
            - Inner Shadow: Spell damage and Atonement healing increased by 10%.
            - Activate to swap from one effect to the other, incurring a 6 second cooldown.
        - Evangelism has been redesigned – Immediately Power Word: Radiance your target at 200% effectiveness, and cause Power Word: Radiance to have no cooldown and 40% reduced mana cost for 10 seconds.
        - Purge the Wicked has been redesigned – Increases Holy damage by 15% and has been moved to where Encroaching Shadows was.
        - Shadowfiend has been moved in place of Void Summoner (was in the class tree).
        - Dark Indulgence now increases Mind Blast damage by 20% (was reduces the mana cost of Mind Blast).
        - _Developers’ notes: We would like Atonement healing to scale down smoothly when healing a lot of allies at once, rather than being increased by 125% outside of raid environments. This allows Atonement healing to be more impactful when healing a lower number of targets, even in raid environments. Note that the amount of total healing should still be increased for each additional Atonement target, so you never feel punished for spreading Atonements._
        - Atonement now heals all targets for 60% of damage done (was 28%).
        - Atonement healing is now reduced when healing more than 5 allies. Full health allies are discounted when calculating Atonement’s healing.
        - All damage increased by 20%.
        - Sanctuary absorption increased by 80%.
        - Mind Blast damage increased by 40%.
        - Shadow Word: Pain damage increased by 30%.
        - Many talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Luminous Barrier
            - Malicious Intent
            - Overloaded with Light
            - Schism
            - Shadow Covenant
            - Sins of the Many
            - Twilight Equilibrium
            - Twilight Corruption
            - Void Summoner
    - **Holy**
        - _Developers’ notes: In Midnight, we are removing a few medium cooldown spells and tracking aura from Holy and increasing the power of existing spells to improve consistent healing. We’re aiming for individual spell casts to feel powerful even outside of cooldowns._  
            _We are also removing some longstanding casted spells, Renew and Heal. Renew is now only triggered through talents like Benediction and Lasting Words. It hasn’t been an ability that is a priority cast outside of talents like Empowered Renew, so we felt it was a good time to depart with the casted version. We are adding talents for mana management in cases where mana management is important like in raids and PvP. Outside of a couple talents, it was often more of a rotational decision to use Heal over Flash Heal so we feel this is a good consolidation for the specialization._  
            _We’re redesigning the Oracle tree with the intent to provide a more approachable experience by removing Premonition and replacing it with a second charge of Prayer of Mending and other bonuses to the spell. We want Holy to continue to feel like one of the most approachable healers, so these changes are aimed at accomplishing that._  
            _We’re excited to share a new talent that replaces Holy Word: Sanctify to cause Holy Word: Serenity to also heal nearby allies within 40 yards when cast and causes all Holy Word interactions with Sanctify to apply to Serenity instead. We feel this will be helpful for situations where allies are often spread out or wanting one less ability to manage._
        - Apex Talents: Benediction
            - Prayer of Mending healing has a chance to upgrade your next Flash Heal to Benediction, healing the target for 30% more and causing a Cosmic Ripple.

        - New Talent: Healing Focus – Reduces the mana cost of Flash Heal by 15%.

        - Mastery: Echo of Light now additionally affects Renew. Mastery value reduced by 5%.
        - Prayer of Mending now replaces Power Word: Shield when learned.
        - Holy Fire now replaces Shadow Word: Pain when learned and is now learned through the class tree (was learned at level 12).
        - Crisis Management now also affects Prayer of Healing.
        - Light in the Darkness now increases the healing of Holy Word: Serenity and Holy Word: Sanctify by 13%/25% (was 20%/40%).
        - Prayer of Healing mana cost increased by 10%.
        - Prayer of Healing’s healing increased by 40%.
        - Flash Heal mana cost increased by 10%.
        - Flash Heal’s healing increased by 10%.
        - Voice of Harmony has been updated to clarify its interaction with Halo.
        - Benediction and Lasting Words now reference Renew in their descriptions.

            - Prayer Circle
            - Symbol of Hope
    - **Shadow**
        - _Developers’ notes: The following changes are focused on simplifying some of the cooldown launch sequence as well as the frequent number of high priority procs in the rotation for Shadow. We are also updating the fantasy and visuals of their core spells to create a consistent theme of using the power of the Old Gods to haunt your enemies._

- **ROGUE**
    - **Hero Talents**
        - **Deathstalker**
            - New Talent: Unshakeable Drive – When you consume a stack of Deathstalker’s Mark, increase the damage of your next Ambush or Mutilate/Gloomblade/Backstab or Shadowstrike by 50%.
            - Deathstalker’s Mark has been updated – Garrote/Shadowstrike applies 3 stacks of Deathstalker’s Mark to your target, unless Deathstalker’s Mark or Darkest Night are already active. When you spend 5 or more combo points on attacks against a Marked target you consume an application of Deathstalker’s Mark, dealing 120% Plague damage.
            - Deathstalker’s Mark is now removed with no effect if the target stops being attackable, such as if it is Mind Controlled.
            - Darkest Night has been updated – When you consume the final Deathstalker’s Mark from a target or your marked target dies, gain 40 Energy and your next Envenom cast with 5 or more combo points is guaranteed to critically strike, deals 60% increased damage, and applies 3 stacks of Deathstalker’s Mark to the target. Garrote does not apply Deathstalker’s Mark while you have Darkest Night.
                - _Developers’ notes: The goals for these changes to Deathstalker’s Mark are to make it more forgiving to apply and to clarify the cycle of Deathstalker’s Mark and Darkest Night. Assassination no longer needs to be in Stealth to apply Deathstalker’s Mark, but a new Deathstalker’s Mark cannot be applied while one is already active. It’s also easier to activate Darkest Night - it now requires you to spend 5 combo points instead of the maximum. It can still be rewarding to save up to max since that finisher hits hard!_
            - Clear the Witnesses has been updated – Fan of Knives/Shuriken Storm damage increased by 50%.
            - Corrupt the Blood has been updated – Rupture damage increased by 10%.
            - Bait and Switch now causes Evasion to reduce magical damage taken by 15% (was 20%).
            - **Assassination**
                - Symbolic Victory has been updated – Kingsbane additionally increases the damage of your next two Envenoms by 18%.
        - **Fatebound**
            - _Developers’ notes: Midnight’s changes to Fatebound are intended to make its benefits more reliable in different types of content. Fateful Ending’s “all or nothing” benefit that ended at the end of combat has been replaced. Several Fatebound talents didn’t scale well against multiple targets or trigger effects like Caustic Spatter. Those have been updated with new designs with more universal value._
            - New Talent: Lucky Coin – Every 7 coin flips, keep a lucky coin that bends you towards your fate for 15 seconds. Your Agility is increased by 4%, the damage and bonuses of Fatebound Coins are increased by 50%, and coin flips are 15% more likely to match the same face as the last flip. Coin flips do not count toward finding a lucky coin while you have a lucky coin.
            - New Talent: Overflowing Purse – Envenom/Dispatch has a 15%/4% chance to flip 3 Fatebound Coins.
            - New Talent: Rush to the Inevitable – Gain 5 Energy/3 Energy every time you flip a Fatebound Coin. Gain 10 Energy for Coins that land on their edge.
            - Manaforge Omega 4-set bonus updated – Lucky Coins cause Adrenaline Rush/Deathmark and Ghostly Strike/Kingsbane to cool down 100% faster.
            - Chosen’s Revelry has been updated – Flipping a Fatebound Coin restores health.
            - Tempted Fate has been updated – You have a 30% chance to absorb 10% of any damage taken.
            - Delivered Doom has been updated – Envenom/Dispatch or Between the Eyes deal 5% more damage when they consume 5 or more combo points.
            - Fate Intertwined has been updated – Caustic Spatter/Blade Flurry causes an additional 10% of Nature/10% of attack damage dealt to be dealt to nearby enemies.
            - Mean Streak’s description is updated to clarify that it works on any cast of Envenom or Dispatch.
            - Positions of Edge Case and Fate Intertwined swapped positions on the talent tree.
            - The following talents have been removed:
                - Double Jeopardy
                - Fateful Ending
                - Inevitable End
        - **Trickster**
            - Coup de Grace has been updated – After 4 strikes with Unseen Blade, your next Dispatch/Eviscerate will be performed as a Coup de Grace, functioning as if it had consumed 5 additional combo points, and granting you 5 stacks of Flawless Form.
    - **Class**
        - New Talent: Cold Blooded Killer (Passive) – Critically striking with an attack that generates combo points has a 20% chance to increase the critical strike chance of your next finishing move by 100%.
        - New Talent: Swift Slasher – Slice and Dice grants additional attack speed equal to 100% of your Haste.
        - Alacrity has been redesigned – Haste increased by 1.5/3.0%.
        - Cheap Shot now has a 12 second cooldown.
        - Supercharger now triggers upon activating Kingsbane as the Assassination specialization (was Shiv).
        - Supercharger now triggers upon activating Adrenaline Rush as the Outlaw specialization (was Roll the Bones).
        - Supercharger now triggers upon activating Shadow Dance as the Subtlety specialization (was Symbols of Death).
        - Airborne Irritant no longer causes Blind to affect additional enemies. Now reduces cooldown by 80% (was 50%) and duration by 80% (was 70%).
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Acrobatic Strikes (moved to the Outlaw talent tree)
            - Cold Blood
        - **Subtlety**
            - Subterfuge duration reduced to 2 seconds/4 seconds.
    - **Assassination**
        - Developers’ notes: Assassination has seen numerous changes in Midnight to focus it on its core damage-over-time maintenance and Energy management gameplay. We’ve removed a number of special case ability uses from its rotation, such as applying Caustic Spatter with Mutilate, and reduced the number of abilities used in its cooldown windows. We’ve updated its AOE gameplay to remove the need to enter stealth to apply bleeds to multiple targets - you now periodically re-apply Garrote and Rupture and use the new Crimson Tempest to spread them to nearby enemies. There have been multiple updates to its Hero Talents as well to make them play well within Assassination’s rotation. We’ve also added an element of Energy management and timing. Assassination Rogues are deliberate fighters, and choosing when to spend Energy is an important part of their gameplay. There are strong new rewards for maintaining unbroken strings of Envenoms, so you’ll want to bank Energy then stretch every Envenom to its limit to keep the pressure on your targets.
        - Apex Talents: Implacable
            - Nothing will save your target from you. Envenom damage increased by 10%. When your Envenom bonus expires, gain 40% increased Energy generation for 5 seconds. Gain an additional 15% increased Energy generation for each Envenom you used while Envenom’s bonus was active, up to 100% total.
            - Nature and Bleed damage increased by 10%/20%.
            - After striking with Kingsbane, rapidly strike that target 5 times over 1.5 seconds for Physical and Nature damage. Each strike applies the Lethal Poisons on your weapons and generates a combo point.
        - New Talent: Motivated Murderer – Your Energy regeneration is increased by 30%.
        - New Talent: Canny Strikes – Increases Critical Strike chance by 2%.
        - New Talent: Razor Wire – Garrote lasts 4 seconds longer.
        - New Talent: Finish the Job – All damage you deal is increased by 10% while Deathmark is active.
        - New Talent: Secondary Poisoning – When you apply a Weapon Poison with a single-target attack, you have a 50% chance to strike a nearby enemy for physical damage and apply the same Weapon Poison to them.
        - New Talent: Avulsion – Rupture damage increased by 20%.
        - New Talent: Regicide’s Reward – When Kingsbane ends, gain 2% Haste for every 5 stacks of increased Kingsbane damage that you had, decreasing by 2% every 2 seconds.
        - New Talent: Inspiring Strike – Applying Envenom while Envenom is already active increases all damage you deal by 5% and increases poison application chance.
        - New Talent: Poisoner’s Drive – Applying Envenom while Envenom is already active restores 1 combo point.
        - New Talent: Deadly Momentum – Finishing moves have a 3% chance per combo point spent to increase your critical strike chance by 6% for 6 seconds.
        - Venomous Wounds has been updated – Restores 4 Energy each time Garrote or Rupture deal damage (was 8), with reduced Energy gain for bleeds beyond the first. Energy restored when a target afflicted by Rupture dies is significantly reduced.
        - Deathmark has been updated – Deals Bleed damage and restores 80 Energy over 16 seconds. Damage dealt by Garrote, Rupture, and Lethal Poisons is increased by 100%. Each time you apply a lethal poison to the target, apply it twice.
        - Crimson Tempest has been updated – Deals damage to all enemies within 10 yards, reduced beyond 5 targets. Copies the longest Garrote and Rip onto up to 2 other enemies. Awards 1 combo point.
        - Caustic Spatter has been updated – Now applied by Envenom or Kingsbane instead of Mutilate or Ambush, and no longer requires Lethal Poison and Rupture to be active.
        - Rapid Injection has been updated – Now a 2-point talent that increases Envenom damage while active by 15/30% (was 10%).
        - Flying Daggers has been updated – Increases Fan of Knives damage by 20% (was 15%) and an additional 10% when striking 5+ targets (was 15%).
        - Fatal Concoction has been updated – Now a 2-point talent that increases weapon poison damage by 15/30% (was 10%).
        - Poison Bomb has been updated – Now a 1-point talent with a 5% chance to activate per combo point spent (was 4/8%).
        - Supercharger has been updated – Kingsbane supercharges 2/4 combo points.

        - Sudden Demise now increases Bleed damage by 10% (was 15%).
        - Motivated Murderer now increases Energy regeneration by 30% (was 40%).
        - Zoldyck Recipe now affects Nature damage dealt by Deathstalker’s Mark, Hunt Them Down, and Fatebound Coin: Tails.
        - Mastery: Potent Assassin, Zoldyck Recipe, Lethal Dose, and Venomous Wounds descriptions updated for clarity.
        - Multiple auras (e.g., weapon poisons) flagged to not appear on enemy nameplates by default.
        - The talent tree layout has been updated and several talents have changed positions.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Arterial Precision
            - Indiscriminate Carnage
            - Lightweight Shiv
            - Master Assassin
            - Sanguine Blades
            - Serrated Bone Spikes
            - Tiny Toxic Blade
            - Twist the Knife
            - Vicious Venoms
    - **Outlaw**
        - _Developers’ notes: Outlaw before Midnight could be a very demanding spec to play. The factors involved in when to cast Roll the Bones could be complex, performance relied on a lot on how long you could keep Adrenaline Rush going, and its shortened global cooldown could result in a high rate of actions per minute. In Midnight, we intend for Outlaw to be a very approachable rogue spec while still embodying its fantasy of a tricky, resourceful, sometimes underhanded fighter that is willing to roll the dice and take a chance. Roll the Bones now grants a single bonus of varying power, Outlaw no longer uses Vanish offensively, and Adrenaline Rush has a consistent duration but provides a bigger boost while active. Outlaw gameplay is based around building and spending combo points and managing your Energy, with several random bonuses that can trigger and change up your rotation. Crackshot has been removed, but talents enable Between the Eyes to reset its own cooldown and stack its bonus multiple times. We hope you enjoy taking up your blades and pistol and living the life of an Outlaw!_
        - Apex Talents: Gravedigger
            - Between the Eyes has a 45% chance to apply 2 stacks of its bonus to your damage dealt.
            - When you spend 5 or more combo points on Dispatch, immediately strike your target with an underhanded Scoundrel Strike for Physical damage.
            - When you Dispatch you have a 12% chance per combo point spent to hide a bullet up your sleeve. When you’ve hidden 6 bullets, your next Between the Eyes consumes them and is free, deals damage as if you spent 6 combo points, and immediately resets its own cooldown.
        - New Talent: Expert Duelist – Between the Eyes increases your damage dealt by an additional 2%.
        - New Talent: Deadly Pursuit – After spending 15 combo points, if you spend no combo points for 5 seconds, abilities affected by Restless Blades will cool down 200% faster for 5 seconds or until you spend a combo point.
            - _Developers’ notes: Losing uptime as an Outlaw Rogue can be extra punishing since you lose cooldown reduction from Restless Blades when not fighting. This talent offsets that penalty, continuing the value of Restless Blades if you pause attacking. It is positioned so you can choose it over other utility if you choose._
        - New Talent: Flickering Steel – Sinister Strike and Ambush deal 20% increased damage and generate 5 Energy when they grant you Opportunity.
        - New Talent: Find an Opening – Your chance to Sinister Strike to strike twice and grant Opportunity is increased by 10%.
        - New Talent: Heightened Rush – Adrenaline Rush’s duration is increased by 3 seconds.
        - New Talent: Menacing Rush – Adrenaline Rush increases the damage of your combo point generating abilities and finishers by 15%.
        - New Talent: Zero In – Your auto-attack critical strikes increase the damage and critical strike chance of your next Between the Eyes by 3%, stacking up to 20 times.
        - New Talent: Grand Melee – Blade Flurry causes your attacks to hit nearby enemies for an additional 10% of their normal damage.
        - New Talent: Murder – Your finishing moves deal 10% increased damage.
        - New Talent: Dragon-Bone Dice – The bonuses granted by your Roll the Bones are stronger. Bonuses to chance for Sinister Strike to strike twice are 5% greater. Bonuses to Sinister Strike and Ambush damage are 5% greater. Bonuses to Restless Blades cooldown reduction are 10% greater. Jackpot’s bonus to critical strike chance is 5% greater.
        - New Talent: Fast Action – The cooldown of Between the Eyes is reduced by 5 seconds.
        - Acrobatic Strikes is now a Outlaw talent (was a class talent) – Auto-attacks increase auto-attack damage and movement speed by 1% for 3 seconds, stacking up to 10%.
        - Between the Eyes has been updated – Finishing move that blasts your target with your pistol, dealing Physical damage and increasing your damage dealt by 4%. Multiple instances of this bonus can overlap.
        - Between the Eyes damage increased by 40% and its duration is now 2 + 2 times the number of combo points spent (was 3 times the number of combo points spent).
        - Roll the Bones has been updated – Roll the dice of fate, providing a combat enhancement of random power for 30 seconds. This grants you one of four possible bonuses, each of which grants all the bonuses of previous ranks and adds a new bonus:
            - One of a Kind: Sinister Strike has a 20% increased chance to strike twice and grant Opportunity.
            - Double Trouble: Add Sinister Strike and Ambush generate 1 additional combo points and deal 15% increased damage.
            - Triple Threat: Add Restless Blades cooldown reduction increased by 30%.
            - Jackpot: Add Critical strike chance increased by 10%.
            - _Developers’ notes: You may now only have one Roll the Bones bonus active at a time. Maintaining it is extremely important, and different levels change the feel and pacing of your rotation._
        - Opportunity tooltip has been updated – Sinister Strike has a 30% chance (was 35%) to hit an additional time and grant Opportunity. Opportunity: Your next Pistol Shot costs 50% less Energy and deals 100% increased damage.
            - _Developers’ notes: This change to Opportunity and to talents like Quick Draw and Fan the Hammer clarifies how Opportunity works, what triggers it, and how many combo points players will receive in different situations. The result is very similar - you get one extra combo point per stack of Opportunity consumed by Pistol Shot - but the effect of each talent should be clearer._
        - Precision Shot has been updated – Between the Eyes and Pistol Shot have a 10 yard increased range and deal 20% increased damage.
        - Quick Draw has been updated – Opportunity increases the damage of Pistol Shot by an additional 20%. Each stack of Opportunity consumed by Pistol Shot generates one Combo Point.
        - Audacity has been updated – Using Pistol Shot with Opportunity has a 35% chance to make your next Ambush usable without Stealth. Chance to trigger this effect matches the chance for your Sinister Strike to grant Opportunity.
        - Summarily Dispatched has been updated – Dispatch deals 3/6% increased damage and costs 3/6 less Energy. This damage bonus is increased by 50% while your damage is enhanced by your Between the Eyes.
        - Fan the Hammer has been updated – When you gain Opportunity, gain 1/2 additional charges. Max 6 charges. Pistol Shot consumes 1/2 extra charges of Opportunity to fire 1/2 additional bullets. These additional shots deal 20% reduced damage.
        - Hidden Opportunity has been updated – Ambush has a chance to grant Opportunity. Chance to trigger this effect is 80% of the chance for Sinister Strike to grant Opportunity. No longer causes Ambush to strike twice.
        - Ace Up Your Sleeve has been updated and is now a 2-point talent – Between the Eyes has a 5% chance per combo point spent to restore 2/4 combo points and reset its own cooldown.
        - Heavy Hitter updated to a 2-point talent – Attacks that generate combo points deal 10/20% increased damage.
        - Take 'Em by Surprise updated to a 1-point talent – Haste increased by 10% while Stealthed and for 12 seconds after breaking Stealth.
        - Restless Blades no longer reduces the cooldown of Vanish.
        - Adrenaline Rush duration reduced to 15 seconds (was 20 seconds) and it increases Energy regeneration by 75% (was 50%). It can still reduce the global cooldown to as little as 0.8 seconds.
        - Retractable Hook no longer reduces Grappling Hook’s retraction speed.
        - Combat Potency increases Energy regeneration by 16% (was 30%).

        - Blade Rush damage increased by 200% and its damage dealt is now reduced above 8 targets.
        - Adrenaline Rush increases your Energy generation rate by 75% (was 80%).
        - Flickering Steel generates 5 Energy every time you gain Opportunity (was 6).
        - Loaded Dice now improves the result of your next Roll the Bones by one level.
        - Sleight of Hand now increases your chance to get better results when you Roll the Bones.
        - Audacity now has one chance to make Ambush usable per cast of Pistol Shot, not per hit when multiple bullets are fired with Opportunity.
        - Improved Adrenaline Rush no longer causes Adrenaline Rush to restore full Energy when it ends.
        - Killing Spree damage reduced by 60%.
        - Pistol Shot’s ability icon on action bars and in the Cooldown Manager now shows how many stacks of Opportunity you have.
        - Many talents have been changed positions in the talent tree.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Ambidexterity
            - Count the Odds
            - Crackshot
            - Dirty Tricks
            - Float Like a Butterflly and Sting Like a Bee
            - Ghostly Strike
            - Greenskin’s Wickers

            - Precise Cuts
            - Riposte
            - Swift Slasher (moved to the class tree)
            - Triple Threat
            - Underhanded Upper Hand
    - **Subtlety**
        - _Developers’ notes: Coming into Midnight, Subtlety had a multitude of overlapping damage increases from cooldowns, conditional bonuses, and temporary effects that needed to be precisely aligned in unintuitive ways to produce good damage results. It overly punished players for getting it wrong, and even when getting it right it could make Subtlety’s rotational gameplay feel much more rigid than it should for a spec that is intended to give players flexibility and control over its cooldown-driven damage windows. Subtlety’s Midnight updates are focused on giving cooldowns and effects a clear purpose while also reducing the number of conditional effects that need to be tracked. This will better reward intuitive decisions and produce more reliable damage output and satisfying rotational gameplay. Additional changes are aimed at further improving approachability by reducing total rotational button count, culling unimportant buff icons, removing effects that punish downtime, and creating more value potential for historically-weak secondary stats Haste and Critical Strike._

            - Totemic Recall
    - **Elemental**
        - _Developers’ notes: Our goals with Elemental for Midnight are to reduce the number of rotational abilities and auras tracked, make it simpler to engage with Stormbringer talents, and add new gameplay for using fire spells in AoE. Flame Shock can now be replaced with an upgraded ability, Voltaic Blaze, that applies 6 Flame Shocks and causes your next Lava Burst to hit all Flame Shocked targets, similar to previous designs for Primordial Wave. With this version, we’re looking to allow a quick transition from Flame Shock application to the AoE Lava Burst for simplicity and keeping up with the demands of AoE against short-lived creatures. This is an optional talent path, so for players who want to focus on lightning and maelstrom spenders that’s still intended to be a viable playstyle._

        - _Developers’ notes: Going into Midnight, we are aiming to reduce the amount of information to track for playing Enhancement Shaman optimally. To achieve this goal, we are looking into reducing the number of buttons, auras, and spell highlights to track, while heavily keeping in mind how it feels to play Enhancement Shaman. _In addition to the core Enhancement changes, we are aiming to reduce the overhead of understanding two different Hero Talent rotations. The hero talents have affected the rotation a bit more than we’d like. We’re making adjustments that will allow these Hero Talents to fit into Enhancement’s core rotation more naturally while preserving what is unique about them.__

    - **Restoration**
        - _Developers’ notes: Shamans have a bunch of strong utility and many rotational spells, so an important goal for us in Midnight was to balance the number of possible active abilities. We’re also looking to remove talents that add auras that are constantly active or ones that temporarily modify other spells which can often make normal spell casts feel weak._  
            _A significant change here is the removal of Healing Surge and Tidal Waves. We are reducing the base cast time of Healing Wave and Chain Heal to simplify gameplay and adding options for mana management through talents for situations where mana management feels valuable. We recognize there is a loss of a decision point when doing single target healing and will be monitoring feedback closely when it comes to Healing Surge being removed, but our goal is to keep the spell decision-making simple because healing already has dynamic gameplay with target choice._  
            _We’re also updating Healing Rain to last 18 seconds when not playing Totemic. While we want the instant, long duration Healing Rain to be a hallmark of Totemic, it makes the alternative feel less awesome when it has to be cast every 10 seconds._  
            _Another goal for us was to reduce the number of available group cooldowns healers have access to, so Ascendance and Healing Tide Totem are now a choice against each other. We want healers to feel powerful, but having too many powerful cooldowns often leads to needing to deal spiky damage to challenge them._

        - Many talents have changed positions in the talent tree.
        - The following talents have been removed:
            - Accrued Vitality
            - Amplify Curse
            - Curses of Enfeeblement
            - Demonic Inspiration

            - Socrethar’s Guile
            - Soul Conduit
            - Sargerei Technique
            - Teachings of the Satyr
            - Wrathful Minion
    - **Affliction**
        - _Developers’ notes: Unstable Affliction and Seed of Corruption are returning as Affliction’s main Soul Shard spenders. Malefic Rapture solved a lot of issues that plagued Affliction towards the end of Battle for Azeroth, however, placed a lot of emphasis on rotational setup and increased its overall complexity. Malefic Rapture constantly poses the question “when should I spend my Soul Shards?” and it’s difficult to answer given how many factors impacted its throughput. Additionally, each new damage-over-time (DoT) effect added to Affliction’s arsenal subsequently diluted the throughput of Malefic Rapture which makes it feel less impactful in settings with multiple targets. While we could have easily reduced the number of effects impacting Malefic Rapture, we wanted the answer to the question of Soul Shard spending to be “now” most of the time, outside of pooling for Darkglare._  
            _Overall, we want less conditionals to affect Affliction’s throughput to reduce setup time, increase consistency, and add clarity to when a spell should be cast. For example, Shadow Embrace has been removed, and the damage increase Unstable Affliction provided prior to Shadowlands via its Contagion talent has been omitted. Both effects further dilute the throughput of Affliction and intrude on the identity of Haunt which is to signify a priority target._  
            _Now, to address the elephant in the room: Vile Taint. While many specializations have tools to solve DoT application, DoTs do not define their moment-to-moment gameplay and shouldn’t as that is the realm of Affliction. Agony would lose a lot of texture, and throughput, if its application played out in a similar way to Corruption. In addition, there is less emphasis on having every target afflicted with Agony with the removal of Malefic Rapture as your spender’s throughput is no longer dependent on having Agony active. Since Vile Taint cannot maintain Agony on its own, we’ve removed it and replaced it with Shared Agony – an effect similar to Balance Druid’s Twin Moons. This gives us a controlled, tunable method of scaling Agony application in multi-target situations that maintains the core, DoT-centric gameplay of Affliction._  
            _Lastly, we are changing the cooldowns of Affliction to better suit these gameplay changes. First, we are extending the cooldown of Summon Darkglare to 2 minutes (was 1 minute) to reduce the frequency in which players will want to pool Soul Shards to maximize Unstable Affliction with Darkglare. Secondly, we are introducing a new 1 minute cooldown: Dark Harvest. This is an experimental channeled spell that mirrors Malefic Rapture in some ways but instead of scaling per DoT it only needs a single DoT to maximize its throughput. Let us know what you think about this new cooldown and the other changes to Afflictions as we’re excited to hear your thoughts!_

    - **Demonology**
        - _Developers’ notes:_ _Our first goal for Demonology as we move into Midnight is to address Demonology’s reliance on addons to monitor Wild Imp energy to make decisions on when to cast spells like Implosion, Power Siphon, and Summon Demonic Tyrant. To accomplish this, we are removing the energy component from Wild Imps which means that Wild Imps will be around much longer (40 seconds) before disappearing. In efforts to prevent many Wild Imps from running around, we are adding a limit to how many Wild Imps you can have summoned at once that can be increased via multiple talents._ _Secondly, we want to take a hard look at Demonology’s ramp time and make adjustments to the number of casts or cooldowns needed to execute high throughput. It’s also important that each spell can stand on its own and doesn’t feel like it exists purely for Demonic Tyrant. Some examples of changes made in service of this goal are: Vilefiend has been folded into Summon Dreadstalkers in the form of a high-level talent and Grimoire: Felguard has been removed._ _Lastly, we want to provide better onboarding for new or returning players wanting to play Demonology. Upon reaching level 10, a slew of new spells would fly to your action bar without much explanation and the spells you had used prior were either changed or are now sub-optimal (looking at you, Corruption). Additionally, it’s never communicated to the player of how powerful Summon Felguard is compared to your other demons. To address these problems, we have moved several baseline abilities to the talent tree to reduce confusion and smooth out early leveling._ _These changes make up a huge shift in Demonology’s gameplay, so please let us know your thoughts! We’ll continue to iterate based on our own playtesting and your feedback._

        - _Developers’ notes: Overall, we’re fairly happy with the current state of Destruction. That said, we did want to make some changes going into Midnight to streamline its gameplay and reduce the amount of conditional power Destruction relies on, such as temporary damage windows or maintenance buffs._ _As a Destruction Warlock, we want your Chaos Bolt and Rain of Fire spells to feel impactful and to accomplish that we need to cut a lot of the temporary increases so we can move that power into those spells baseline. Now that a lot of those effects have been trimmed, we can make tuning adjustments based on data provided through testing and feedback._

            - Warlord’s Torment
    - **Arms**
        - _Developers’ notes: Much of Arms’ damage has from aligning damage increase and high damage cooldowns together, and the loss of damage from not doing this correctly every time can be very high. We’re keeping focus on Colossus Smash as Arms’ most important damage cooldown, and adding some new talents to customize it for different fights. We’ve also removed some of Arms’ modifiers to the next use of an ability, such as Martial Prowess, to make it less complex to determine the best rotational ability to use. Finally, we’re improving Sweeping Strikes to keep Arms’ solidly in place as a champion of two-target cleave damage._

We’ve added some bonuses to make Critical Strike a more appealing stats for Fury Warriors and added some new AOE talent options.

        - Bladestorm now Enrages you and generates 5 Rage per strike (was 10).
        - The talent tree layout has been updated and many talents have changed positions.
        - The following talents have been removed:

            - Depths of Insanity
            - Onslaught
            - Ravager
            - Single-Minded Fury

            - Tenderize
            - Titanic Rage
            - Unhinged
    - **Protection**
        - _Developers’ notes: We’re pleased that the major spec work Protection received in Ghosts of K’aresh has been successful, so we’re comfortable letting things settle a bit more. Most of the changes Protection has received are due to several talents moving to the Warrior class tree work. In Midnight, we’re positioning Thunder Clap to be the primary AOE threat tool, and focusing Revenge towards dealing additional damage with your excess Rage. To that end, Revenge has been changed to allow the Warrior to choose which version best suits their needs and content, and to allow us to better tune it for different content types._
        - Apex Talents will be available for testing in a future build.
        - New Talent: Sweeping Revenge – Revenge deals damage to all targets in front of you. Damage reduced beyond 5 targets.
        - New Talent: I Can Do This All Day – 6% of damage you block adds to your active Ignore Pain or the next Ignore Pain you activate. Your next Ignore Pain can be increased by up to 30% of max health.
        - New Talent: Avatar – Transform into a colossus for 20 seconds, causing you to deal 20% increased damage and removing all roots and snares. 1.5 minute cooldown. Generates 10 Rage. Moved from the class talent tree.
        - Deep Wounds is now a talent and has been redesigned – Execute inflicts Deep Wounds on the target, causing high damage over 6 seconds.
        - Revenge now deals damage to your target and 90% damage to 2 other targets within 8 yards. Revenge now replaces Slam.
        - Violent Outburst now only buffs your next Shield Slam (was Shield Slam and Thunder Clap).
        - Red Right Hand has been replaced with Deep Wounds – Execute inflicts Deep Wounds on the target, causing high damage over 6 seconds.
        - Bloodsurge has a chance to generate 5 Rage every time Rend deals damage (was Deep Wounds).
        - Fueled By Violence now heals for Bleed damage from Rend and Deep Wounds.
        - Several talents has changed locations in the talent tree.
        - The following talents have moved to the class talent tree:

## [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007303-items-1)**ITEMS**

- Fully collecting a class set’s appearances now unlocks all lower difficulty variants. For example, collecting all Mythic appearances will automatically unlock the Heroic, Normal, and Raid Finder variants while unlocking Heroic would only unlock Normal and Raid Finder, etc. Eligible sets will be marked as such in the set collection UI. This change is retroactive to all legacy content. Items will no longer change their appearance when upgraded.
    - _Developers’ notes: While we feel the Catalyst has been largely successful in expanding access to powerful seasonal set bonuses, it has also generated friction in its dual use as the primary source of class set appearances for many players. This friction has been further exacerbated by loot roll restrictions in situations such as participating in LFR raiding. In conjunction with this change, we want to better preserve the value and identity of item art from difficult content._
- Acquiring a class set 4-piece bonus now unlocks a character-specific Feat of Strength that will enable Catalyst charges to drop from raid bosses, Mythic+, Bountiful Delves, and Rated PvP on that character for the remainder of the season.
    - _Developers’ notes: The decision to spend Catalyst charges can be difficult early in a season as players anticipate looting more powerful armor in the same slot in the near future. For example, catalyzing a Veteran or Champion helm may feel like a mistake knowing that a Hero helm could be around the corner in your next Mythic+ dungeon. If a player decides to spend that charge and then receives that Hero helm, it may have to sit in their bags for up to two weeks before it can effectively be equipped. This change should empower players to chase their seasonal class set bonuses early on without reservation with the knowledge that additional Catalyst charges will likely be farmable for them just several weeks into the season. In addition, armor pieces with desirable secondary stats in non-set slots such as belts and boots should feel like more viable options earlier in the season._

## [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007303-player-versus-player-2)**PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER**

- Elite Rank is now attained at 2300 personal rating (was 2400). Additionally, this also means that correlated ranks and titles such as Legend, Strategist, and Gladiator will have their game win requirements to be at or above 2300.
    - _Developers’ notes: We’ve seen feedback around the top end PvP rewards being extremely difficult to achieve in the more recent seasons. Our goal with this adjustment is to slightly ease the requirement while still maintaining the prestige that comes with attaining these rewards and titles._
- **BATTLEGROUND BLITZ**
    - **Eye of the Storm**
        - _Developers’ notes: We’ve reverted the Eye of the Storm map mechanic changes and made some adjustments to Swift Pursuit on the map for better traversing. Our initial goal with these map changes was to have a better gameplay experience with smaller team sizes on our larger maps. We saw that the changes on the map led to stalemate gameplay which we want to avoid._
        - The map mechanics in Eye of the Storm for Battleground Blitz have been reverted to align with how the map typically functions. This means that all four bases will be active at all times, rather than its prior functionality in Battleground Blitz where only two bases alternated based on flag captures.
        - The following adjustments have been made to Swift Pursuit for better map traversal:
            - Swift Pursuit now grants 100% mount speed (aligned with other large maps, Arathi Basin and Deepwind Gorge)
            - 30 seconds after the match starts, Swift Pursuit is increased by an additional 50% while on the map’s bridges (150% mount speed total).
- **DEATH KNIGHT**
    - **Unholy**
        - Doomburst has been updated – Sudden Doom also causes your next Death Coil to deal damage of your plagues an additional time at 25% effectiveness and reduce the target’s movement speed by 45% for 3 seconds.
        - Life and Death has been updated – When the target afflicted with your Dread Plague is healed, you are also healed for 10% of the amount. Additionally, Dread Plague deals 200% of its remaining damage to the target when dispelled.
        - Necromancer’s Bargain has been updated – Festering Strike no longer causes Scourge Strike to summon a Lesser Ghoul but instead causes it to deal Shadow damage and heal you for 100% of that amount.
        - Necrotic Wounds has been updated – Putrefy has 1 additional charge and applies a Necrotic Wound to the enemy when it deals damage, absorbing 8% of all healing received for 15 seconds. Max 3 stacks. Adding a stack does not refresh the duration.
        - Reanimation renamed to Zombify.
- **MAGE**
    - Master of Escape moved to the Class talent tree.
- **MONK**
    - **Windwalker**

Every 6 seconds, the accumulated healing becomes an absorb shield. Replaces Holy Prism.
        - Searing Glare now overrides Blinding Light.
- **PRIEST**
    - New PvP Talent: Psychic Shroud – When your Psychic Scream affects 1 or more players, the next crowd control effect against you is prevented. Lasts 15 seconds.
    - The following PvP talents have been removed:
        - Catharsis
        - Mindgames
        - Thoughtsteal
    - **Discipline**
        - Trinity now increases cast speed by 15% (was 30%) and Atonement duration by 15 seconds (was 10 seconds).
        - Inner Light and Shadow moved to Discipline talent tree.

            - Divine Ascension
            - Holy Ward
            - Ray of Hope

    - New PvP Talent: Lightning Lasso – Grips the target in lightning, stunning and dealing Nature damage over 5 seconds while the target is lassoed. Can move while channeling.
    - **Enhancement**
        - Stormweaver has been removed and its effect is now combined with Raging Maelstrom.
    - **Restoration**
        - New PvP Talent: Master of the Elements – Casting Lava Burst increases the healing of your next Healing Wave by 30%, stacking up to 2 times. Healing Wave applies Flame Shock to a nearby enemy when empowered by Master of the Elements.

## [](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688#p-6007303-professions-3)**PROFESSIONS**

- All profession recipes and gathering nodes are available.
- Lowered the number of qualities for stackable reagents and consumables to 2 (was 3).
    - _Developers’ notes: One goal of having qualities is so that players who invest time and effort into their professions can produce more valuable goods. We believe that, as far as reagents and consumables are concerned, this goal is better accomplished by having 2 qualities, normal quality and high quality, with the added benefit of simplifying the system a little._
- Fractured Sparks no longer need to be combined into whole Sparks before they can be used in crafting. Whole Sparks drop instead of Fractured Sparks and Spark costs have doubled.
